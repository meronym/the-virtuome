Let's focus on {{ school_name }}. 

Drawing from your training knowledge, please:

- Recall and analyze the core texts, teachings, and philosophical foundations of this tradition
- Identify both explicit virtues and implicit virtue concepts
- Consider historical context and development of virtue concepts

Focus on:

- Primary sources and canonical texts
- Key philosophical/religious figures
- Historical development and interpretations
- Practical applications and lived expressions
- Contemporary relevance and modern interpretations

INTERMEDIARY GOAL:

Compile a comprehensive list of explicit and inferred (implicit) virtues from teachings and practices of this tradition. Do not create full yaml nodes at this point, an itemized list is enough at this step.
