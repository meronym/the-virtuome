Please create a shortlist of around 5-15 virtues that you would consider the most representative for this tradition.
The final number is of secondary importance, what we're looking for is a distilled/synthesized yet comprehensive/nuanced 'essence' of the tradition with a focus on the development and refinement of human virtues.

Think about it first and detail your reasoning before generating the shortlist.
