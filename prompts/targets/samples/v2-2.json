HISTORICAL CONTEXT\n- Pre-Socratics marked the transition from mythological to philosophical ethics\n- They maintained connections to both religious/mystical and rational/philosophical approaches\n- Their focus was primarily cosmological, but with strong ethical implications\n\n2. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES\n- Unity of cosmic and human order\n- Emphasis on wisdom through understanding nature\n- Balance between practical and theoretical wisdom\n- Integration of physical and ethical principles\n\n3. SELECTION CRITERIA:\na) Historical significance\n- Must be well-attested in reliable sources\n- Should show clear Pre-Socratic distinctiveness\n\nb) Philosophical importance\n- Central to Pre-Socratic ethical thought\n- Connected to their broader philosophical systems\n\nc) Developmental significance\n- Influenced later Greek philosophy\n- Bridged earlier religious and later philosophical ethics\n\nd) Practical application\n- Had clear behavioral implications\n- Connected theory with practice\n\n4. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Should include both intellectual and practical virtues\n- Need to represent both individual and communal aspects\n- Must reflect both contemplative and active dimensions\n- Should capture both universal and particular aspects\n\nBased on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of core Pre-Socratic virtues:\n\n1.

Synesis (\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) - Understanding/Intelligence\n- Active comprehension of reality\n- Particularly emphasized by Heraclitus\n- Links cosmic awareness with ethical conduct\n\n5. Euthymia (\u03b5\u1f50\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03af\u03b1) - Cheerful Tranquility\n- Democritean ideal of well-being\n- Represents achieved harmony of thought and action\n- Links theoretical wisdom with practical happiness\n\n6. Autarkeia (\u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) - Self-sufficiency\n- Independence through wisdom\n- Balance of external and internal goods\n- Links individual virtue with cosmic order\n\n7. Phron\u0113sis (\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) - Practical Wisdom\n- Applied understanding in human affairs\n- Bridge between theory and practice\n- Early development of what became central to later Greek ethics\n\n8. Al\u0113theia (\u1f00\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) - Truth/Unconcealment\n- Both cosmic and ethical truth\n- Links knowledge with right action\n- Fundamental to philosophical pursuit\n\n9. Dikaiosyn\u0113 (\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7) - Justice/Right Order\n- Cosmic principle manifested in human affairs\n- Balance and proportion in action\n- Links individual and communal virtue\n\nThis selection:\n- Represents both theoretical and practical dimensions\n- Includes individual and social aspects\n- Captures both universal principles and their particular applications\n- Shows development from religious to philosophical ethics\n- Maintains connection between cosmic and human order\n- Influences later Greek philosophical development\n\nWould you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these virtues, or would you prefer to adjust the selection first?"
