Let me analyze this carefully to distill the most representative virtues of Empiricist Ethics.

REASONING PROCESS:

1. CORE PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS
The empiricists fundamentally believed that:
- Moral knowledge comes from experience rather than pure reason
- Moral judgments are based on sentiment and utility rather than abstract principles
- Social harmony and practical outcomes matter more than theoretical ideals
- Human nature combines both self-interest and natural sympathy
- Moral development occurs through experience and education

2. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES
What makes Empiricist Ethics unique:
- Focus on observable consequences rather than a priori principles
- Emphasis on moral sentiments and natural sociability
- Integration of individual and social good
- Practical approach to moral development
- Balance between reason and emotion in moral life

3. SELECTION CRITERIA
To be truly representative, virtues should:
- Reflect the empirical methodology
- Incorporate both individual and social dimensions
- Connect moral sentiment with practical action
- Support both personal and public good
- Enable moral development through experience

4. HISTORICAL IMPACT
Considering the influence on:
- Scientific method in moral philosophy

- Educational theory

5. CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE
