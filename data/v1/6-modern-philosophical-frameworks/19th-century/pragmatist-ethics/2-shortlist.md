Let me think through this systematically:

REASONING PROCESS:

1. CORE PRINCIPLES OF PRAGMATIST ETHICS:
- Focus on practical consequences
- Emphasis on growth and development
- Integration of individual and social
- Experimental method in ethics
- Democratic commitment
- Education as key to moral development

2. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS:
Pragmatist virtues differ from other traditions in that they:
- Are more process-oriented than fixed
- Emphasize growth over perfection
- Integrate thinking and action
- Focus on social context
- Are inherently experimental
- Connect individual and community development

3. SELECTION CRITERIA:
To be truly representative, the virtues should:
- Reflect both individual and social dimensions
- Include both intellectual and moral aspects
- Represent both theoretical and practical orientations
- Capture the dynamic/developmental nature
- Connect to democratic practice
- Enable growth and problem-solving

4. SYNTHESIS APPROACH:
The list should:
- Cover the main domains of pragmatist thought
- Show interconnections between virtues
- Reflect both personal and social transformation
- Enable practical application
- Support democratic life
- Foster continuous development

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of most representative pragmatist virtues:

CORE PRAGMATIST VIRTUES:

1. CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE
- The capacity for reflective problem-solving
- Integration of thinking and experience
- Foundation for other virtues

2. EXPERIMENTAL DISPOSITION
- Willingness to test ideas in practice
- Openness to revision
- Anti-dogmatic attitude

3. SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE
- Understanding of social contexts
- Capacity for cooperative inquiry
- Democratic sensibility

4. MELIORISTIC COURAGE
- Commitment to possibility of improvement
- Moral courage in face of uncertainty
- Active hope

5. DEMOCRATIC FAITH
- Trust in collaborative problem-solving
- Commitment to inclusive dialogue
- Public-mindedness

6. GROWTH-MINDEDNESS
- Orientation toward development
- Capacity for self-correction
- Learning from experience

7. PRACTICAL WISDOM
- Situation-sensitive judgment
- Integration of means and ends
- Action-oriented understanding

8. RECONSTRUCTIVE HABIT
- Ability to transform experience
- Creative problem-solving
- Adaptive intelligence

These eight virtues form an interconnected set that:
- Covers individual and social dimensions
- Integrates thought and action
- Supports democratic practice
- Enables continuous growth
- Facilitates problem-solving
- Promotes social progress

Each virtue supports and enhances the others, creating a dynamic system of moral development rather than a static list of traits. This reflects the pragmatist emphasis on growth, experimentation, and the integration of individual and social development.

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these core virtues?
