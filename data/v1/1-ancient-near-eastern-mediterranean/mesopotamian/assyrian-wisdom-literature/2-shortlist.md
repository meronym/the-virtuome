Let me think through this systematically:

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:

1. CORE CONSIDERATIONS:
- What made Assyrian civilization distinctive
- What virtues were consistently emphasized across different texts
- Which virtues were most crucial for societal functioning
- How these virtues integrated religious, political, and social spheres

2. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF ASSYRIAN WISDOM:
- Strong emphasis on practical governance
- Integration of divine and earthly order
- Importance of hierarchical relationships
- Focus on institutional stability
- Value of accumulated wisdom
- Emphasis on proper timing and discretion

3. KEY SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Textual prominence (frequency in sources)
- Structural importance (role in society)
- Cultural distinctiveness (Assyrian characteristics)
- Practical impact (real-world application)
- Conceptual interconnectedness (relationship to other virtues)

4. CONTEXTUAL FACTORS:
- Urban civilization requirements
- Imperial administrative needs
- Temple-state relationship
- Scribal culture importance
- Multi-ethnic empire management

REASONING FOR SYNTHESIS:

The ideal shortlist should:
1. Capture both personal and institutional virtues
2. Reflect the practical-wisdom orientation
3. Include both active and contemplative qualities
4. Represent different social spheres (religious, political, personal)
5. Show interconnection between divine and human orders

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of most representative virtues:

1. NĒMEQU (Wisdom)
- Central concept combining practical, spiritual, and administrative wisdom
- Encompasses both learned knowledge and experiential understanding
- Foundation for all other virtues

2. KĪTTU (Justice/Truth)
- Fundamental principle of cosmic and social order
- Encompasses both truth-speaking and just action
- Essential for governance and personal conduct

3. UZNU (Discretion/Understanding)
- Critical faculty for both rulers and advisors
- Combines practical judgment with social awareness
- Essential for institutional functioning

4. PALĀḪU (Reverent Respect)
- Applies to both divine and human authorities
- Foundation for proper hierarchical relationships
- Links personal conduct with cosmic order

5. ŠITMUDU (Diligence/Attentiveness)
- Essential for both professional and personal excellence
- Combines careful observation with dedicated action
- Key to institutional stability

6. KĪNŪTU (Loyalty/Reliability)
- Crucial for political and social stability
- Combines personal faithfulness with institutional duty
- Maintains social and administrative cohesion

7. ṬĒMU (Discrimination/Good Judgment)
- Ability to analyze situations and make sound decisions
- Combines intellectual capacity with practical wisdom
- Essential for leadership and counsel

These seven virtues form an interconnected system where:
- Each virtue supports and enhances the others
- Together they cover personal, professional, and spiritual domains
- They represent both individual excellence and social harmony
- They combine practical effectiveness with moral rightness
- They integrate divine approval with earthly success

This selection aims to capture the essence of Assyrian wisdom while remaining true to historical evidence and cultural context. Each virtue is well-attested in sources and played a crucial role in Assyrian society's functioning.
