Let me think through this systematically:

ANALYTICAL PROCESS:
1. Modern Jewish Ethics uniquely combines:
   - Traditional Jewish values
   - Modern philosophical insights
   - Post-Holocaust theological perspectives
   - Contemporary social concerns
   - Universal humanitarian principles

2. Key characteristics of this tradition:
   - Balance between particularism and universalism
   - Integration of ancient wisdom with modern thought
   - Strong emphasis on practical ethics over theoretical virtue
   - Focus on both individual and communal responsibility
   - Commitment to world improvement
   - Synthesis of ritual and ethical dimensions

3. Selection criteria for representative virtues:
   - Must bridge traditional and modern understanding
   - Should reflect both individual and communal dimensions
   - Need to capture both practical and spiritual aspects
   - Should demonstrate the tradition's distinctive approach
   - Must be actively engaged with contemporary challenges

4. Particular considerations:
   - The post-Holocaust Jewish ethical imperative
   - The tension between universalism and Jewish particularity
   - The relationship between ritual and ethical behavior
   - The role of individual conscience and communal responsibility
   - The integration of social justice with spiritual growth

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of the most representative virtues:

1. Tikkun Olam (תיקון עולם) - World Repair
   - Represents the synthesis of particular Jewish responsibility and universal ethical concern
   - Combines personal improvement with social justice
   - Exemplifies the modern Jewish approach to ethical engagement

2. Achrayut (אחריות) - Responsibility
   - Encompasses both individual and collective responsibility
   - Bridges religious duty and civic engagement
   - Reflects modern emphasis on conscious ethical choice

3. Kavod HaBriyot (כבוד הבריות) - Human Dignity
   - Universal principle with particular Jewish interpretation
   - Fundamental to modern Jewish social ethics
   - Basis for contemporary human rights advocacy

4. Yosher (יושר) - Ethical Uprightness
   - Combines ritual observance with ethical behavior
   - Emphasizes integration of religious and secular ethics
   - Focuses on practical daily conduct

5. Areivut (ערבות) - Mutual Responsibility
   - Reflects Jewish communal ethics
   - Extends to global humanitarian concern
   - Emphasizes interconnectedness

6. Da'at (דעת) - Ethical Knowledge/Consciousness
   - Combines traditional learning with modern critical thinking
   - Emphasizes informed ethical decision-making
   - Integrates reason and tradition

7. Rachamim (רחמים) - Compassion
   - Transformed by post-Holocaust consciousness
   - Extended to universal application
   - Basis for contemporary social action

8. Tzedek (צדק) - Justice

   - Central to contemporary Jewish ethical action

9. Emet (אמת) - Truth
   - Encompasses intellectual honesty and moral truth

This list captures the essential characteristics of Modern Jewish Ethics by:
- Showing the integration of traditional and modern values
- Reflecting both individual and communal dimensions
- Emphasizing practical ethical action

Each virtue represents not just a single concept but a cluster of related ethical principles and practices, making them particularly representative of the tradition's approach to moral development and ethical living.
