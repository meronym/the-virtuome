Key Distinctive Features of Protestant Ethics:\n- Emphasis on individual responsibility before God\n- Integration of faith and daily life\n- Strong work ethic and vocational calling\n- Balance of personal piety and social responsibility\n- Emphasis on scriptural authority and direct relationship with God\n\n2. Historical Considerations:\n- Protestant Reformation's break from Catholic virtue traditions\n- Development of distinctly Protestant approaches to sanctification\n- Influence on modern Western work and social ethics\n- Balance between Luther's emphasis on faith and Calvin's on discipline\n\n3. Selection Criteria:\n- Must reflect core Protestant theological distinctives\n- Should bridge personal and social dimensions\n- Need to capture both spiritual and practical aspects\n- Should reflect Protestant understanding of sanctification\n- Must be applicable across various Protestant traditions\n\n4. Organizational Logic:\n- Starting with foundational spiritual virtues\n- Moving to personal character development\n- Extending to social and practical applications\n- Including distinctly Protestant expressions\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the distilled shortlist of most representative Protestant virtues:\n\n1. FAITHFULNESS (Glaubenstreue)\n- Core Protestant emphasis on faith alone\n- Personal trust in divine providence\n- Loyalty to scriptural truth\n- Foundation for all other virtues\n\n2. CONSCIENTIOUSNESS (Gewissenhaftigkeit)\n- Individual moral responsibility\n- Direct accountability to God\n- Careful attention to duty\n- Ethical self-reflection\n\n3. DILIGENCE (Flei\u00df)\n- Protestant work ethic\n- Vocational calling\n- Stewardship of talents\n- Excellence in daily tasks\n\n4. INTEGRITY (Rechtschaffenheit)\n- Unity of faith and action\n- Moral consistency\n- Truthfulness in all dealings\n- Personal authenticity\n\n5. SOBRIETY (N\u00fcchternheit)\n- Self-discipline\n- Moral restraint\n- Clear-minded judgment\n- Practical wisdom\n\n6. STEWARDSHIP (Haushalterschaft)\n- Responsible management of resources\n- Care for creation\n- Wise use of time and talents\n- Economic responsibility\n\n7.

Each virtue represents a cluster of related qualities and practices, making the list both comprehensive and focused.\n\nThe German terms are included where relevant because much Protestant ethical thought was developed in German-speaking contexts, though the concepts are universal within Protestant traditions."
