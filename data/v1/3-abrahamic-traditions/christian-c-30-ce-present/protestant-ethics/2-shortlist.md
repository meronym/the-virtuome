Let me think through this analytically:

REASONING PROCESS:

1. Key Distinctive Features of Protestant Ethics:
- Emphasis on individual responsibility before God
- Integration of faith and daily life
- Strong work ethic and vocational calling
- Balance of personal piety and social responsibility
- Emphasis on scriptural authority and direct relationship with God

2. Historical Considerations:
- Protestant Reformation's break from Catholic virtue traditions
- Development of distinctly Protestant approaches to sanctification
- Influence on modern Western work and social ethics
- Balance between Luther's emphasis on faith and Calvin's on discipline

3. Selection Criteria:
- Must reflect core Protestant theological distinctives
- Should bridge personal and social dimensions
- Need to capture both spiritual and practical aspects
- Should reflect Protestant understanding of sanctification
- Must be applicable across various Protestant traditions

4. Organizational Logic:
- Starting with foundational spiritual virtues
- Moving to personal character development
- Extending to social and practical applications
- Including distinctly Protestant expressions

Based on this analysis, here's the distilled shortlist of most representative Protestant virtues:

1. FAITHFULNESS (Glaubenstreue)
- Core Protestant emphasis on faith alone
- Personal trust in divine providence
- Loyalty to scriptural truth
- Foundation for all other virtues

2. CONSCIENTIOUSNESS (Gewissenhaftigkeit)
- Individual moral responsibility
- Direct accountability to God
- Careful attention to duty
- Ethical self-reflection

3. DILIGENCE (Fleiß)
- Protestant work ethic
- Vocational calling
- Stewardship of talents
- Excellence in daily tasks

4. INTEGRITY (Rechtschaffenheit)
- Unity of faith and action
- Moral consistency
- Truthfulness in all dealings
- Personal authenticity

5. SOBRIETY (Nüchternheit)
- Self-discipline
- Moral restraint
- Clear-minded judgment
- Practical wisdom

6. STEWARDSHIP (Haushalterschaft)
- Responsible management of resources
- Care for creation
- Wise use of time and talents
- Economic responsibility

7. WITNESS (Zeugnis)
- Living testimony of faith
- Moral example
- Social responsibility
- Cultural engagement

These seven virtues:
- Cover both individual and social dimensions
- Include both spiritual and practical aspects
- Reflect distinctive Protestant emphases
- Bridge traditional and modern expressions
- Can be traced through Protestant history
- Remain relevant to contemporary life
- Are recognizable across Protestant traditions

This selection captures the essence of Protestant virtue ethics while remaining practically applicable. Each virtue represents a cluster of related qualities and practices, making the list both comprehensive and focused.

The German terms are included where relevant because much Protestant ethical thought was developed in German-speaking contexts, though the concepts are universal within Protestant traditions.
