Let me think about this systematically.

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

1. For Modern Islamic Ethics, we need virtues that:
- Bridge traditional Islamic values with contemporary challenges
- Address both individual and collective responsibilities

2. Key selection criteria:
- Foundational importance in traditional sources

3. Considering structural relationships:

- Some should be developmental (supporting growth and adaptation)

4. Modern context requirements:
- Addressing technological challenges
- Supporting environmental responsibility
- Enabling intercultural dialogue
- Promoting social justice
- Facilitating ethical professional conduct
