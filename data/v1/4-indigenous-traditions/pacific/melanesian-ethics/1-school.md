Here's an analysis of Melanesian ethical concepts and virtues, acknowledging that these vary across different island cultures and communities:

1. Communal Values:
- Wantok (kinship/reciprocal relationships)
- Collective responsibility
- Intergenerational obligation
- Clan solidarity

2. Land-Based Ethics:
- Environmental stewardship
- Sacred landscape connection
- Ancestral land guardianship
- Resource sustainability

3. Spiritual-Social Integration:
- Ancestral reverence
- Spirit world harmony
- Ritual correctness
- Sacred knowledge preservation

EXPLICIT VIRTUES:
1. Reciprocity (giving/receiving obligations)

3. Communal sharing
4. Ritual knowledge
5. Land stewardship
6. Ancestral veneration
7. Truth-telling in community contexts
8. Generosity within social networks
9. Hospitality to kin
10. Cultural preservation

IMPLICIT VIRTUES:

2. Social harmony maintenance
3. Ancestral wisdom recognition
4. Community consensus-building
5. Ritual precision
6. Traditional knowledge protection
7. Kinship obligation fulfillment
8. Resource distribution wisdom
9. Intergenerational teaching
10. Sacred site protection

BEHAVIORAL PRINCIPLES:
1. Reciprocal obligation fulfillment

3. Elder respect
4. Child nurturing
5. Clan identity
6. Ancestral connection
7. Community peace
8. Traditional authority

10. Cultural continuity

Note: These concepts are derived from anthropological studies, oral traditions, and contemporary practice observations. The categorization is somewhat artificial as many of these concepts overlap and interrelate in practice.

Key considerations:
- Variations exist between different Melanesian cultures
- Concepts are often embedded in practical actions rather than abstract principles
- Many virtues are expressed through relationship maintenance rather than individual attributes
- Environmental and spiritual aspects are often inseparable
- Modern adaptations continue to evolve these concepts

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect or move forward with creating detailed YAML nodes for specific virtues?
