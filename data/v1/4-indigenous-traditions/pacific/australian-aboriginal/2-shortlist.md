Let me think through this carefully:

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:
1. Need to identify virtues that are:
   - Widely shared across different groups
   - Fundamental rather than derivative
   - Central to Aboriginal worldview
   - Clearly focused on human development
   - Interconnected with core cultural concepts

KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
1. The Aboriginal worldview is fundamentally relational:
   - Between people
   - With country
   - With ancestors
   - With spiritual forces
   - Across time

2. Knowledge and wisdom are:
   - Layered
   - Progressive
   - Context-dependent
   - Practice-based
   - Responsibility-linked

3. Core concepts tend to be:
   - Holistic rather than atomized
   - Process-oriented rather than static
   - Relationship-based rather than individualistic
   - Practical rather than abstract
   - Experiential rather than theoretical

SELECTION CRITERIA:
1. Must reflect the interconnected nature of Aboriginal philosophy
2. Should bridge personal development and communal responsibility
3. Must acknowledge the spiritual-material unity in Aboriginal thought
4. Should capture both active and receptive aspects
5. Must respect the practical wisdom orientation

Based on this analysis, I would propose these as the most representative virtues:

1. DADIRRI (Deep Listening)
- Encompasses both spiritual and practical attention
- Fundamental to learning and wisdom
- Connects individual to community and country
- Base for developing other virtues

2. KANYINI (Holding/Responsibility)
- Integrates caring for country, people, and knowledge
- Represents responsible relationship maintenance
- Links individual development with collective duty
- Encompasses stewardship principles

3. RALYA (Right Way Behavior)
- Proper conduct according to law/lore
- Encompasses protocol awareness and respect
- Links personal discipline with cultural maintenance
- Foundation for social harmony

4. MARRPAN (Strength/Resilience)
- Both personal and cultural resilience
- Combines physical, emotional, and spiritual strength
- Links individual capability with community sustainability
- Essential for cultural continuation

5. GURRUTU (Proper Relationship)
- Understanding and maintaining right relationships
- Encompasses kinship obligations and social harmony
- Links individual identity with collective belonging
- Base for social ethics

6. DJAMBATJ (Cleverness/Capability)
- Practical wisdom and skillful action
- Combines knowledge with appropriate application
- Links individual development with community benefit
- Essential for cultural practice

7. GALKA (Deep Understanding)
- Wisdom beyond surface knowledge
- Combines spiritual insight with practical knowledge
- Links individual learning with cultural transmission
- Essential for leadership and teaching

8. MUNGGRITJ (Sacred Knowledge Responsibility)
- Proper handling of cultural knowledge
- Combines learning with teaching obligations
- Links personal development with cultural preservation
- Essential for tradition maintenance

These eight virtues form an interconnected system that:
- Covers the main domains of Aboriginal ethical life
- Represents both personal and collective aspects
- Includes both active and receptive qualities
- Maintains the holistic nature of Aboriginal philosophy
- Acknowledges the practical-spiritual unity

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these virtues?
