Let me think through this systematically.

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:
To identify the most representative virtues, I'll consider:

1. FOUNDATIONAL CRITERIA:
- Frequency of appearance across different Polynesian cultures
- Centrality to worldview and social organization
- Depth of influence on other virtues
- Practical impact on daily life and social relations

2. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Need to capture both individual and collective dimensions
- Balance between spiritual and practical aspects
- Coverage of human-nature-spirit relationships
- Representation of both active and contemplative virtues

3. ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES:
The Polynesian worldview is fundamentally:
- Relational (everything is connected)
- Holistic (spiritual-physical unity)
- Hierarchical (respecting proper order)
- Ecological (embedded in nature)
- Genealogical (ancestral connections)

4. KEY INSIGHTS:
- The most fundamental virtues tend to be those that maintain harmony across multiple dimensions (personal, social, environmental, spiritual)
- Core virtues often appear as both personal qualities and collective responsibilities
- The most essential virtues typically connect daily practice with deeper spiritual principles

Based on this analysis, I propose this shortlist of core representative virtues:

1. MANA
- Foundational concept of spiritual power/authority
- Links personal conduct with cosmic order
- Underlies both rights and responsibilities

2. ALOHA/AROHA
- Fundamental principle of love/compassion
- Governs both personal relations and universal connection
- Integrates emotional and practical care

3. PONO
- Righteousness/balance/harmony
- Bridges personal conduct and cosmic order
- Guides ethical decision-making

4. KULEANA
- Responsibility/privilege/duty
- Links rights with obligations
- Connects individual to community

5. MÄ€LAMA
- Active care/stewardship
- Applies to people, land, and traditions
- Practical expression of deeper values

6. HO'OPONOPONO
- Restoration of harmony/balance
- Integrates personal and social healing
- Practical conflict resolution

7. MAURI
- Life force/vitality
- Connects physical and spiritual realms
- Basis for environmental ethics

8. MANAAKITANGA
- Generosity/hospitality/care
- Practical expression of communal values
- Links individual conduct with collective welfare

9. TAPU/KAPU
- Sacred restrictions/proper order
- Maintains spiritual-social boundaries
- Guidelines for respect and protection

This selection:
- Covers individual, social, and environmental dimensions
- Includes both practical and spiritual aspects
- Represents both personal qualities and social responsibilities
- Captures the interconnected nature of Polynesian ethics
- Provides framework for both personal development and social harmony

Each virtue here serves as a node in an interconnected web of meaning, with practical applications ranging from personal conduct to environmental stewardship to community leadership.

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these core virtues?
