Let me think through this carefully.

REASONING PROCESS:

1. CORE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Need to identify virtues that are both foundational and widely shared across different Native North American nations
- Must respect the holistic/interconnected nature of Indigenous thought
- Should capture both individual character development and communal/ecological relationships
- Need to acknowledge that these virtues often exist in relationship rather than isolation

2. SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Prevalence across multiple nations/regions
- Centrality to Indigenous worldviews
- Documented historical significance
- Contemporary relevance
- Interconnective capacity (how the virtue connects to others)

3. STRUCTURAL THINKING:
- Many Native American ethical systems emphasize balance between:
  * Individual and community
  * Human and natural world
  * Material and spiritual realms
  * Present actions and future consequences

4. KEY PATTERNS:
- Relationship-based understanding of virtue
- Emphasis on practical wisdom over abstract principles
- Integration of spiritual and material aspects
- Multi-generational perspective
- Connection to land/place
- Emphasis on harmony/balance

5. METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Need to avoid oversimplification while seeking common threads
- Must acknowledge these are translations/interpretations of complex concepts
- Should preserve the interconnected nature of these virtues

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of core representative virtues:

1. RESPECT (encompasses reverence for all relations - human, natural, spiritual)
- Foundation for all other virtues
- Extends beyond human relationships to all of creation
- Manifests in both action and attitude

2. WISDOM (practical, spiritual, and ecological understanding)
- Gained through experience and elder teachings
- Includes both traditional knowledge and adaptive learning
- Emphasizes practical application over abstract knowledge

3. GENEROSITY (sharing, hospitality, community mindedness)
- Central to social harmony
- Demonstrates proper relationship with resources
- Reflects understanding of interconnectedness

4. HARMONY (balance, peace-making, right relationship)
- Both internal and external
- Encompasses relationship with nature
- Includes conflict resolution and personal balance

5. RESPONSIBILITY (to community, future generations, land)
- Seven generations perspective
- Stewardship of resources
- Fulfillment of social duties

6. COURAGE (moral, physical, and spiritual bravery)
- Standing for truth
- Facing adversity
- Maintaining cultural integrity

7. HUMILITY (recognition of one's place in the greater whole)
- Understanding of human limitations
- Proper relationship with creation
- Openness to learning

8. PERSEVERANCE (patience, endurance, resilience)
- Maintaining cultural ways
- Overcoming challenges
- Long-term perspective

9. TRUTHFULNESS (honesty in word and action)
- Alignment of speech and behavior
- Maintenance of integrity
- Sacred obligation to truth

These virtues are deeply interconnected and often manifest together rather than in isolation. They form a web of ethical understanding that guides both personal development and communal life.

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these core virtues?
