Let me analyze how to best distill the Neo-Platonic virtue system.

REASONING:

1. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Neo-Platonism is fundamentally about ascent from multiplicity to unity
- The system is hierarchical, with each level transcending but including the previous
- The ultimate goal is henosis (union with the One)

2. KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Integration of intellectual and spiritual development
- Emphasis on purification and transformation
- Balance between contemplative and practical virtues
- Recognition of both individual and universal aspects

3. SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Must represent different levels of spiritual development
- Should include both transformative processes and achieved states
- Need to capture both theoretical and practical aspects
- Should reflect the tradition's unique contributions
- Must maintain internal coherence as a system

4. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Some virtues are means, others are ends
- Later Neo-Platonists added theurgic elements
- The tradition synthesizes Platonic, Aristotelian, and mystical elements
- Virtues often have both individual and cosmic dimensions

Based on this analysis, I propose the following shortlist of core representative virtues:

1. THEORIA (θεωρία) - Contemplative Vision
- Foundation of the system
- Bridges intellectual and spiritual realms
- Active at multiple levels of development

2. KATHARSIS (κάθαρσις) - Purification
- Essential transformative process
- Operates at all levels
- Links lower to higher virtues

3. SOPHIA (σοφία) - Wisdom
- Represents highest intellectual virtue
- Combines knowledge and understanding
- Bridges theoretical and practical

4. NOUS (νοῦς) - Divine Intelligence
- Higher than discursive reason
- Direct intellectual intuition
- Connection to divine mind

5. APATHEIA (ἀπάθεια) - Divine Detachment
- Freedom from lower passions
- Prerequisite for higher development
- Active stillness

6. HENOSIS (ἕνωσις) - Divine Union
- Ultimate goal
- Transcends ordinary virtue
- Unity beyond multiplicity

7. EROS THEIOS (ἔρως θεῖος) - Divine Love
- Motivating force of ascent
- Combines affective and noetic
- Links human and divine

8. DIAKRISIS (διάκρισις) - Spiritual Discrimination
- Essential for practical progress
- Combines wisdom and discernment
- Guards against error

9. KALLOS THEION (κάλλος θεῖον) - Divine Beauty
- Metaphysical principle
- Aesthetic and moral dimension
- Attracts soul upward

This selection:
- Spans the full range of Neo-Platonic development
- Includes both process and achievement virtues
- Represents intellectual, moral, and mystical aspects
- Forms a coherent system of spiritual development
- Captures the essence of Neo-Platonic virtue ethics

Each virtue operates at multiple levels and interacts with the others in a dynamic system of spiritual development. Together, they form a complete path from ordinary human consciousness to divine union.

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these core virtues?
