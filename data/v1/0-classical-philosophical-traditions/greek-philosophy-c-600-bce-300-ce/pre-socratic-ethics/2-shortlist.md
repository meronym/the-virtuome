Let me think through this systematically.

REASONING PROCESS:

1. HISTORICAL CONTEXT
- Pre-Socratics marked the transition from mythological to philosophical ethics
- They maintained connections to both religious/mystical and rational/philosophical approaches
- Their focus was primarily cosmological, but with strong ethical implications

2. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES
- Unity of cosmic and human order
- Emphasis on wisdom through understanding nature
- Balance between practical and theoretical wisdom
- Integration of physical and ethical principles

3. SELECTION CRITERIA:
a) Historical significance
- Must be well-attested in reliable sources
- Should show clear Pre-Socratic distinctiveness

b) Philosophical importance
- Central to Pre-Socratic ethical thought
- Connected to their broader philosophical systems

c) Developmental significance
- Influenced later Greek philosophy
- Bridged earlier religious and later philosophical ethics

d) Practical application
- Had clear behavioral implications
- Connected theory with practice

4. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Should include both intellectual and practical virtues
- Need to represent both individual and communal aspects
- Must reflect both contemplative and active dimensions
- Should capture both universal and particular aspects

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of core Pre-Socratic virtues:

1. Sophia (σοφία) - Wisdom
- Primary virtue integrating cosmic and human understanding
- Bridges contemplative and practical knowledge
- Central to Pre-Socratic philosophical project

2. Harmonia (ἁρμονία) - Harmony
- Reflects cosmic order in human conduct
- Links mathematical, natural, and ethical orders
- Particularly emphasized by Pythagoreans

3. Metrion (μέτριον) - Measure/Right Proportion
- Key to understanding proper conduct
- Connects cosmic order with human behavior
- Present across multiple Pre-Socratic schools

4. Synesis (σύνεσις) - Understanding/Intelligence
- Active comprehension of reality
- Particularly emphasized by Heraclitus
- Links cosmic awareness with ethical conduct

5. Euthymia (εὐθυμία) - Cheerful Tranquility
- Democritean ideal of well-being
- Represents achieved harmony of thought and action
- Links theoretical wisdom with practical happiness

6. Autarkeia (αὐτάρκεια) - Self-sufficiency
- Independence through wisdom
- Balance of external and internal goods
- Links individual virtue with cosmic order

7. Phronēsis (φρόνησις) - Practical Wisdom
- Applied understanding in human affairs
- Bridge between theory and practice
- Early development of what became central to later Greek ethics

8. Alētheia (ἀλήθεια) - Truth/Unconcealment
- Both cosmic and ethical truth
- Links knowledge with right action
- Fundamental to philosophical pursuit

9. Dikaiosynē (δικαιοσύνη) - Justice/Right Order
- Cosmic principle manifested in human affairs
- Balance and proportion in action
- Links individual and communal virtue

This selection:
- Represents both theoretical and practical dimensions
- Includes individual and social aspects
- Captures both universal principles and their particular applications
- Shows development from religious to philosophical ethics
- Maintains connection between cosmic and human order
- Influences later Greek philosophical development

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these virtues, or would you prefer to adjust the selection first?
