Let me think through this systematically:

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:

1. CORE PRINCIPLES OF STOICISM:
- Focus on what's within our control
- Living according to nature/reason
- Acceptance of cosmic order
- Development of unshakeable character
- Fulfillment of social duties
- Universal human brotherhood

2. KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
a) The Stoics emphasized:
- Unity of virtues (they saw virtues as interconnected)
- Practical application over theoretical knowledge
- Character development through daily practice
- Rational control over emotions
- Social responsibility despite personal detachment

b) Historical impact:
- Influenced Western philosophy, Christianity, modern psychology
- Practical relevance across cultures and times
- Enduring appeal in personal development
- Application in leadership and resilience training

3. SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Foundational importance in Stoic thought
- Practical applicability
- Clear developmental pathway
- Interconnectedness with other virtues
- Historical consistency across Stoic thinkers
- Contemporary relevance

4. STRUCTURAL THINKING:
We should include virtues that represent:
- Cognitive/rational aspects (wisdom)
- Emotional regulation (temperance)
- Action/behavior (courage)
- Social interaction (justice)
- Character development (integrity)

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of most representative Stoic virtues:

1. PHRONÄ’SIS (Practical Wisdom)
- Foundation of all other virtues
- Ability to make right judgments
- Understanding what is truly important
- Core of Stoic rational approach

2. CONSTANTIA (Steadfastness)
- Inner stability regardless of circumstances
- Emotional resilience
- Consistency between beliefs and actions
- Representative of Stoic ideal of unshakeable character

3. TEMPERANTIA (Temperance)
- Moderation in all things
- Self-control
- Rational management of desires
- Foundation for emotional stability

4. IUSTITIA (Justice)
- Right relations with others
- Fulfillment of social duties
- Expression of human rationality in society
- Connection to universal brotherhood

5. MAGNANIMITAS (Greatness of Soul)
- Elevated perspective on life
- Proper assessment of externals
- Dignity in adversity
- Philosophical maturity

6. DISCIPLINA (Self-Discipline)
- Daily practice of principles
- Continuous self-improvement
- Mastery over impulses
- Practical application of wisdom

7. HUMANITAS (Humanity)
- Universal brotherhood
- Rational benevolence
- Social responsibility
- Practical expression of Stoic cosmopolitanism

8. AUTARKEIA (Self-Sufficiency)
- Independence from externals
- Inner freedom
- Emotional self-reliance
- Foundation for true happiness

This selection:
- Covers both personal and social aspects
- Includes both theoretical and practical virtues
- Represents development from basic to advanced practice
- Maintains internal coherence of Stoic philosophy
- Bridges ancient practice with modern applications
- Provides clear pathway for character development

Each virtue acts as a hub connecting to various related virtues and practices, making this selection both comprehensive and practically applicable while maintaining the essential character of Stoic ethical teaching.

Would you like me to:
1. Elaborate on any of these selections?
2. Explain their interconnections?
3. Proceed with detailed YAML nodes for these core virtues?
4. Analyze their historical development or modern applications?
