Let me reason through this systematically:

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:
1) First, I'll consider what made Roman civic virtue distinctive from other traditions:
- Focus on public/civic life rather than purely personal ethics
- Emphasis on practical application over theoretical frameworks
- Strong connection between individual and collective good
- Integration of personal, political, and religious duties
- Emphasis on exemplary behavior as teaching tool

2) Key selection criteria:
- Central importance in Roman texts and discourse
- Practical impact on Roman civic life
- Enduring influence through Roman history
- Distinctiveness from Greek predecessors
- Integration of public and private spheres

3) Structural considerations:
- Need to cover both personal and public virtues
- Balance between active and contemplative virtues
- Include virtues that connect individual to community
- Represent both leadership and citizenship aspects

4) Historical development factors:
- Evolution from Republican to Imperial periods
- Influence of Stoic philosophy on civic virtue
- Adaptation to changing social conditions
- Integration with Roman religious practice

REASONING FOR FINAL SELECTION:
- Must include VIRTUS as it's foundational and uniquely Roman
- PIETAS essential for connecting private/public/religious spheres
- FIDES crucial for social cohesion and public trust
- GRAVITAS distinctive Roman contribution to leadership virtue
- DIGNITAS represents unique Roman view of earned honor
- AUCTORITAS captures Roman understanding of legitimate power
- IUSTITIA essential for civic order
- CONSTANTIA important for both personal and public steadfastness

PROPOSED SHORTLIST:

1. VIRTUS
(moral excellence/courage)
- Foundation of Roman character
- Combines personal and civic virtue
- Links moral and physical excellence

2. PIETAS
(dutiful respect)
- Connects family, state, and gods
- Fundamental to Roman social order
- Bridges private and public spheres

3. FIDES
(faithfulness/reliability)
- Essential for social bonds
- Basis of Roman contracts and alliances
- Both personal and public trust

4. GRAVITAS
(seriousness/dignity)
- Distinctive Roman leadership quality
- Combines authority with responsibility
- Personal bearing with public impact

5. DIGNITAS
(worth/prestige)
- Earned through service
- Combines honor with responsibility
- Progressive accumulation through life

6. AUCTORITAS
(legitimate influence)
- Based on character and achievement
- Different from pure power
- Essential for leadership

7. IUSTITIA
(justice)
- Foundation of civic order
- Balance of rights and duties
- Both personal and institutional

8. CONSTANTIA
(steadfastness)
- Personal and public perseverance
- Stability in adversity
- Reliable character

9. DISCIPLINA
(self-control/order)
- Essential for both military and civic life
- Personal restraint for public good
- Systematic approach to duty

This list captures the essence of Roman civic virtue while showing how personal excellence was inherently connected to public good. Each virtue represents both individual character development and contribution to collective welfare, which was a distinctive feature of Roman thought.

The selection maintains internal coherence while covering the major aspects of Roman civic life: leadership, citizenship, public service, personal conduct, and social responsibility. It also reflects the Roman emphasis on practical wisdom and lived example rather than abstract theory.
