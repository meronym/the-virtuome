Let me analyze what makes Neo-Stoicism distinctive and how to best capture its essence:

KEY CONSIDERATIONS:

1. HISTORICAL CONTEXT
- Neo-Stoicism emerged during a period of intense religious conflict and political instability
- It needed to address both personal conduct and public service
- It aimed to bridge classical wisdom with Christian faith

2. CORE INNOVATIONS
- Synthesis of private moral philosophy with public action
- Integration of contemplative wisdom with practical governance
- Balance between religious faith and rational philosophy

3. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES
- More politically oriented than classical Stoicism
- More practically focused than pure philosophical schools
- More synthesizing and accommodating than original Stoicism
- Strong emphasis on education and self-development

4. PRIMARY AIMS
- Development of stable character in unstable times
- Formation of capable public servants
- Creation of wise and resilient leaders
- Cultivation of both private virtue and public effectiveness

SELECTION CRITERIA:
1. Must represent both personal and public dimensions
2. Should reflect the Christian-Stoic synthesis
3. Must include both contemplative and active elements
4. Should capture both theoretical wisdom and practical application
5. Must address both individual character and social responsibility

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of the most representative virtues:

1. CONSTANTIA (Steadfastness)
- The cornerstone virtue of Neo-Stoicism
- Represents stability of mind and character
- Bridges personal resilience and public service

2. PRUDENTIA POLITICA (Political Wisdom)
- Combines classical wisdom with practical governance
- Represents the practical application of philosophy
- Essential for public service

3. RATIO CHRISTIANA (Christian Reason)
- Represents the synthesis of faith and philosophy
- Balances religious truth with rational inquiry
- Guides moral decision-making

4. OFFICIUM PUBLICUM (Public Duty)
- Combines personal ethics with civic responsibility
- Represents the active dimension of virtue
- Essential for social order

5. MODERATIO (Moderation)
- Balances different demands and extremes
- Applies to both personal conduct and public policy
- Essential for practical wisdom

6. SAPIENTIA ACTIVA (Active Wisdom)
- Combines contemplative knowledge with practical action
- Represents the educational ideal
- Guides both personal development and public service

7. DECORUM CIVILE (Civil Propriety)
- Combines personal dignity with social grace
- Represents cultural refinement and public behavior
- Essential for social harmony

8. FORTITUDO MORALIS (Moral Courage)
- Combines personal conviction with public responsibility
- Represents ethical strength in challenging times
- Essential for leadership

This shortlist captures:
- The private-public dimension
- The theoretical-practical balance
- The faith-reason synthesis
- The individual-social relationship
- The contemplative-active dynamic

Each virtue represents a key aspect of Neo-Stoic thought while together forming a coherent system for personal development and public service. They reflect both the classical heritage and the innovative adaptations of Neo-Stoicism to its historical context.
