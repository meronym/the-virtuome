Let me analyze this carefully.

REASONING PROCESS:

1. Core Focus of Developmental Psychology:
- Studies how virtues/capabilities emerge and mature over time
- Emphasizes stage-wise progression
- Recognizes interaction between individual and environment
- Values both individual growth and social integration

2. Key Selection Criteria:
- Must represent different developmental domains (cognitive, social, emotional, moral)
- Should be developmentally sequential
- Must be empirically supported
- Should have clear developmental trajectories
- Must be culturally universal while allowing for cultural variation
- Should be foundational for other virtues

3. Integration Points:
- Looking for virtues that bridge multiple theoretical frameworks
- Considering both individual and relational aspects
- Balancing self-development with social contribution
- Including both early-emerging and mature capacities

4. Special Considerations:
- Some virtues are precursors to others
- Some represent more mature integration of earlier capacities
- Some are more fundamental to human development
- Some have stronger empirical support

PROPOSED SHORTLIST:

1. Trust Capacity
- Foundation for all relationship development
- Erikson's first crisis resolution
- Basis for secure attachment
- Enables learning and growth

2. Self-Regulation
- Core developmental achievement
- Underlies multiple competencies
- Crucial for social adaptation
- Developmentally progressive

3. Empathic Understanding
- Bridges self and other
- Develops throughout lifespan
- Cultural universal
- Basis for moral development

4. Perspective Integration
- Cognitive-social milestone
- Enables complex moral reasoning
- Crucial for social adaptation
- Develops sophistication over time

5. Moral Agency
- Combines judgment and action
- Integrates multiple capacities
- Developmentally sophisticated
- Culturally informed but universal

6. Adaptive Resilience
- Dynamic developmental process
- Integrates multiple systems
- Grows through challenge
- Enables sustained development

7. Social Competence
- Complex integration of skills
- Developmentally sequential
- Culturally embedded
- Essential for human flourishing

8. Generative Care
- Mature integration of capacities
- Contributes to society
- Represents developmental achievement
- Bridges individual and collective

This list aims to capture:
- Developmental progression (from basic trust to generative care)
- Multiple domains (cognitive, emotional, social, moral)
- Both individual and relational aspects
- Both early-emerging and mature capacities
- Universal human potentials
- Empirically supported constructs

The virtues are arranged in a somewhat developmental sequence, though they continue developing throughout life and interact with each other. Each represents a complex capacity that integrates multiple skills and abilities, rather than a simple trait.

Would you like me to generate YAML nodes for these eight virtues, or would you prefer to refine the list first?
