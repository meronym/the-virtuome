This list represents a synthesis of explicit virtues stated in literature and implicit virtues derived from practice and discourse. Each category interrelates with others, creating a complex web of digital ethical principles.

Would you like me to:
1. Expand on any particular category?
2. Begin creating detailed YAML nodes for specific virtues?
3. Analyze the relationships between these virtues?
4. Explore the historical development of specific virtues?
