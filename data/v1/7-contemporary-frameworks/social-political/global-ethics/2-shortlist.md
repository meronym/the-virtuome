Let me think through this systematically:

ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK:

1. Core Criteria for Selection:
- Universal applicability across cultures
- Direct relevance to global challenges
- Demonstrable practical impact
- Clear developmental pathway
- Interconnected nature

2. Key Considerations:

a) What makes Global Ethics distinct from other ethical frameworks?
- Its inherently interconnected perspective
- Focus on planetary-scale challenges
- Integration of multiple cultural viewpoints
- Future-oriented outlook
- Systems-level thinking

b) What are the unique contributions of Global Ethics to virtue development?
- Expansion of moral consideration beyond traditional boundaries
- Integration of ecological and technological dimensions
- Emphasis on collective rather than just individual virtue
- Dynamic adaptation to emerging challenges
- Bridge between local and universal perspectives

c) Essential characteristics needed for global ethical engagement:
- Ability to think/act across scales (local to global)
- Capacity for cross-cultural understanding
- Long-term perspective
- Systems thinking capability
- Practical wisdom in complex situations

REASONING FOR SELECTION:

1. We need virtues that:
- Address both individual and collective development
- Bridge theory and practice
- Connect personal growth with global responsibility
- Enable effective navigation of complexity
- Support sustainable future development

2. The selection should:
- Cover different aspects of global ethical engagement
- Maintain internal coherence
- Allow for practical development
- Support both personal and collective transformation
- Address contemporary challenges

3. Balance between:
- Traditional and emerging virtues
- Individual and collective orientation
- Theoretical understanding and practical application
- Local and global perspectives
- Present action and future responsibility

PROPOSED SHORTLIST:

1. Global Mindfulness (全球觉知)
- Conscious awareness of global interconnections
- Recognition of systemic impacts
- Present-moment awareness with global perspective

2. Planetary Stewardship (星球管理)
- Responsible care for Earth systems
- Intergenerational environmental ethics
- Ecological wisdom

3. Cultural Intelligence (文化智慧)
- Cross-cultural understanding
- Intercultural navigation ability
- Diverse perspective integration

4. Collective Responsibility (集体责任)
- Shared accountability
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Common good orientation

5. Systemic Wisdom (系统智慧)
- Complex systems understanding
- Interconnected thinking
- Pattern recognition

6. Future Consciousness (未来意识)

This selection:
- Covers individual to planetary scales
- Integrates traditional and emerging virtues
- Addresses key global challenges
- Provides practical development pathways
- Maintains internal coherence while allowing for diversity

Each virtue is both distinct and interconnected, creating a web of capabilities needed for ethical global citizenship. They represent different aspects of what's needed for effective ethical engagement at a global scale while remaining grounded in personal development.

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these virtues?
