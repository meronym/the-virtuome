These virtues often intersect and reinforce each other, creating a comprehensive ethical framework for addressing colonial legacies and working toward decolonial futures. They emphasize both personal transformation and collective liberation, combining theoretical understanding with practical action.

The framework particularly emphasizes:
- The importance of collective over individual virtues

- The need for both resistance and creation
- The emphasis on healing and transformation
- The recognition of multiple ways of knowing and being

This list represents core virtues explicitly mentioned in post-colonial texts and those that can be inferred from post-colonial practices and movements. Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect or proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for specific virtues?
