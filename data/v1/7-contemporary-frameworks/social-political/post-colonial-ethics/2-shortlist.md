Let me analyze this carefully to distill the most representative virtues of post-colonial ethics.

REASONING PROCESS:

1. CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF POST-COLONIAL ETHICS:
- Focuses on both personal and collective transformation
- Emphasizes the intersection of theory and practice
- Centers on liberation and healing
- Prioritizes recovery and preservation of suppressed knowledge/ways of being
- Addresses power dynamics and structural inequities

2. SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Must address both individual and collective dimensions
- Should capture both resistance and creation aspects
- Need to include both theoretical and practical elements
- Should reflect both healing and transformative aspects
- Must be applicable across different colonial contexts
- Should bridge personal development with social change

3. KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
- The selected virtues should work together as a coherent system
- Each virtue should have depth and complexity
- The set should reflect both immediate and long-term aspects of decolonial work
- Should capture both internal (psychological/spiritual) and external (social/political) dimensions

4. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Post-colonial ethics particularly emphasizes virtues that:
- Challenge colonial mentalities
- Restore damaged cultural/personal identities
- Build new forms of knowledge and being
- Create solidarity and collective power
- Enable healing while maintaining resistance

Based on this analysis, I propose the following shortlist of core post-colonial virtues:

1. CRITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS (conscientização)
- The capacity to recognize, analyze, and act upon oppressive structures
- Combines intellectual understanding with practical action
- Foundation for other decolonial virtues

2. DECOLONIAL LOVE
- Radical self and collective love in face of colonial dehumanization
- Encompasses both healing and resistance
- Basis for authentic relationships and solidarity

3. TESTIMONIAL COURAGE
- Bravery in speaking truth to power
- Preservation and transmission of suppressed knowledge
- Validation of marginalized experiences

4. CULTURAL SOVEREIGNTY
- Preservation and revitalization of indigenous/traditional ways
- Resistance to cultural domination
- Active creation of authentic cultural expressions

5. COLLECTIVE SOLIDARITY
- Building and maintaining networks of mutual support
- Cross-cultural alliance building
- Practical organization for collective liberation

6. EPISTEMIC JUSTICE
- Recognition and validation of multiple ways of knowing
- Challenge to colonial knowledge hierarchies
- Recovery of suppressed knowledge systems

7. RADICAL HOPE
- Capacity to envision and work toward alternative futures
- Maintenance of spirit despite oppression
- Creative imagination of new possibilities

8. RESTORATIVE PRAXIS
- Active work of healing historical trauma
- Rebuilding damaged relationships and systems
- Practical implementation of decolonial theory

9. ANCESTRAL WISDOM
- Connection to traditional knowledge systems
- Intergenerational responsibility
- Spiritual/cultural continuity

These nine virtues form a comprehensive system that:
- Addresses both personal and collective transformation
- Combines theoretical understanding with practical action
- Encompasses both resistance and creation
- Includes both immediate and long-term aspects of decolonial work
- Works at both internal and external levels

Each virtue supports and reinforces the others, creating a holistic framework for personal and collective decolonization. The number nine emerged organically as these virtues seemed to capture the essential aspects while maintaining distinctiveness and avoiding redundancy.

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these core virtues?
