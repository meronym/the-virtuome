Let me think through this systematically:

CORE CONSIDERATIONS FOR DISTILLATION:

1. FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES
- The personal is political
- Intersectionality of experience
- Ethics of care vs. ethics of justice
- Embodied and situated knowledge
- Transformative social change

2. DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS
- Emphasis on relationships and interdependence
- Integration of emotion and reason
- Focus on concrete contexts over abstract principles
- Recognition of power dynamics
- Valuing marginalized perspectives

3. SELECTION CRITERIA:
A representative virtue should:
- Reflect feminist ethics' unique contributions to moral philosophy
- Bridge personal and political dimensions
- Incorporate both care and justice orientations
- Support both individual and collective transformation
- Be applicable across different feminist approaches

4. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK:
Looking for virtues that:
- Have theoretical depth
- Show practical applicability
- Demonstrate historical continuity
- Offer contemporary relevance
- Connect individual and systemic change

5. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Balance between traditional virtues reinterpreted through feminist lens and uniquely feminist contributions
- Include virtues that address both personal development and social transformation
- Represent both resistance to oppression and creation of alternatives
- Include virtues that support both individual and collective action

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of most representative virtues:

1. RELATIONAL AWARENESS
- Core capacity for recognizing and navigating interconnections
- Foundational to feminist ethics of care
- Bridges personal and political spheres

2. CRITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS
- Ability to recognize systemic oppression
- Combines intellectual and emotional understanding
- Leads to transformative action

3. EMPATHIC SOLIDARITY
- Goes beyond simple empathy to include political dimension
- Supports collective action while honoring differences
- Combines care ethics with justice orientation

4. INTEGRATED AUTHENTICITY
- Wholeness of self including emotion, reason, body
- Resistance to imposed definitions/limitations
- Personal truth in social context

5. CONSTRUCTIVE ANGER
- Righteous anger as moral compass
- Catalyst for social change
- Transform rather than suppress/explode

6. RESPONSIBLE POWER
- Ethical use of influence and capability
- Power-with rather than power-over
- Includes mentorship and empowerment of others

7. EPISTEMIC HUMILITY
- Recognition of situated knowledge
- Openness to multiple perspectives
- Particularly from marginalized positions

8. TRANSFORMATIVE IMAGINATION
- Capacity to envision alternatives
- Creative resistance
- Hope in action

9. COURAGEOUS VULNERABILITY
- Strength in openness
- Authentic relationship building
- Risk-taking for change

10. COLLECTIVE CARE
- Extended notion of care beyond individual
- Community responsibility
- Sustainable activism

This list attempts to capture:
- Both personal and political dimensions
- Care and justice orientations
- Individual and collective aspects
- Traditional and innovative elements
- Theory and practice
- Resistance and creation

Each virtue represents a complex cluster of related concepts and practices, developed through feminist thought and activism across different waves and approaches.

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these ten core virtues?
