Let me think through this systematically.

REASONING PROCESS:

1. CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF RENAISSANCE HUMANISM:
- Focus on human potential and dignity
- Synthesis of classical and Christian values
- Emphasis on both contemplation and action
- Balance of individual excellence and civic duty
- Integration of learning and character

2. KEY ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES:
- The ideal of the "complete person" (uomo universale)
- The union of wisdom and eloquence
- The balance of contemplation and action
- The synthesis of personal virtue and civic engagement
- The harmony of classical learning and Christian values

3. SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Must represent both individual and social dimensions
- Should capture both intellectual and moral aspects
- Must reflect the distinctive Renaissance synthesis
- Should include both contemplative and active elements
- Must encompass both personal development and civic contribution

4. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES TO REPRESENT:
- The humanist educational program
- The civic humanist tradition
- The dignity of human nature
- The importance of cultural refinement
- The practical orientation toward life

5. HIERARCHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
Some virtues are foundational or encompass others
Some virtues are means to achieve others
Some virtues represent synthesis of multiple values

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of the most representative virtues:

CORE HUMANIST VIRTUES (in order of foundational importance):

1. HUMANITAS (Cultured Humanity)
- The cornerstone humanist virtue
- Encompasses cultivation of both intellect and character
- Represents the ideal of human flourishing
- Bridges individual excellence and social responsibility

2. DIGNITAS (Human Dignity)
- Recognition of human worth and potential
- Foundation for self-development
- Basis for moral responsibility
- Source of human rights and duties

3. ERUDITIO (Learned Excellence)
- Encompasses both knowledge and wisdom
- Integration of classical learning
- Development of judgment
- Cultural sophistication

4. ELOQUENTIA (True Eloquence)
- Union of wisdom and expression
- Moral and intellectual excellence
- Capacity for leadership
- Social effectiveness

5. PRUDENTIA CIVILIS (Civic Wisdom)
- Practical judgment in public affairs
- Integration of knowledge and action
- Ethical decision-making
- Service to common good

6. CIVILITAS (Civil Conduct)
- Refined social behavior
- Civic responsibility
- Cultural sophistication
- Social harmony

7. MAGNANIMITAS (Greatness of Soul)
- Noble ambition

- Leadership quality

8. DECORUM (Propriety)
- Appropriate behavior
- Social grace
- Ethical judgment
- Cultural refinement

9. STUDIA HUMANITATIS (Liberal Learning)
- Comprehensive education
- Cultural development
- Moral formation
- Intellectual growth

These nine virtues form an integrated system where:
- HUMANITAS and DIGNITAS provide the philosophical foundation
- ERUDITIO and ELOQUENTIA represent the core educational aims
- PRUDENTIA CIVILIS and CIVILITAS address the civic dimension
- MAGNANIMITAS and DECORUM guide personal conduct
- STUDIA HUMANITATIS provides the practical path to cultivation

This selection:
- Captures both theoretical and practical aspects
- Represents individual and social dimensions
- Includes both moral and intellectual elements
- Reflects the distinctive Renaissance synthesis
- Provides a comprehensive framework for human development
