Core Considerations:\n- Which virtues appear most frequently in primary sources?\n- Which virtues are treated as foundational or generative of others?\n- Which virtues uniquely characterize chivalric ethics vs. other medieval virtue systems?\n- Which virtues bridge multiple domains (martial, spiritual, social)?\n\n2. Historical Development:\nThe chivalric tradition evolved from primarily martial origins to incorporate:\n- Christian religious elements\n- Courtly social refinements\n- Literary/romantic ideals\nThis suggests we need virtues representing each developmental layer while focusing on those that achieved synthesis.\n\n3. Practical Impact:\nThe most essential virtues should:\n- Guide both practical conduct and ideal aspiration\n- Bridge internal character and external behavior\n- Apply across multiple contexts (battlefield, court, private life)\n- Support both individual excellence and social harmony\n\n4. Cultural Distinctiveness:\nThe uniquely chivalric contribution to virtue ethics lies in:\n- Synthesis of warrior ethics with Christian morality\n- Integration of martial prowess with social refinement\n- Balance of strength with gentleness\n- Combination of practical skill with moral excellence\n\n5. Legacy and Influence:\nThe most enduring virtues were those that:\n- Transcended their historical context\n- Influenced later ethical traditions\n- Remained relevant to personal development\n- Offered universal human insights\n\nBased on this analysis, I propose the following shortlist as most representative:\n\nCORE CHIVALRIC VIRTUES:\n\n1. PROWESS (Prouesse)\n- Represents excellence in action\n- Combines physical skill with moral purpose\n- Foundation for earning right to exercise other virtues\n\n2. HONOR (Honneur)\n- Integrates personal integrity with social reputation\n- Links individual conscience with communal standards\n- Central to chivalric self-regulation\n\n3. COURTESY (Courtoisie)\n- Elevates strength through refinement\n- Bridges martial and social virtues\n- Humanizes power through grace\n\n4. LOYALTY (Loyaut\u00e9)\n- Structures relationships and obligations\n- Provides framework for service\n- Balances individual excellence with social duty\n\n5. LARGESSE\n- Demonstrates nobility through generosity\n- Links material power with moral responsibility\n- Practical expression of social virtue\n\n6. FRANCHISE\n- Represents noble-minded authenticity\n- Combines freedom with responsibility\n- Balances power with ethical constraint\n\n7. MESURE\n- Controls and directs other virtues\n- Provides wisdom in application\n- Balances competing demands\n\n8. PREUDOMME\n- Represents integrated excellence\n- Combines experience with wisdom\n- Ultimate goal of chivalric development\n\nThis shortlist:\n- Covers major domains (martial, social, moral)\n- Includes both practical and aspirational virtues\n- Represents different stages of tradition's development\n- Maintains internal relationships between virtues\n- Captures distinctive chivalric synthesis\n\nWould you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML+Markdown nodes for these eight core virtues?"
