Let me analyze this carefully to distill the most representative virtues of Korean Neo-Confucianism.

REASONING PROCESS:

1. DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF KOREAN NEO-CONFUCIANISM:
- Strong emphasis on the Four-Seven Debate (사단칠정론) - relationship between moral emotions and human nature
- Focus on practical self-cultivation rather than purely theoretical discussion
- Particular attention to the role of reverence (경/敬) in moral development
- Balance between principle (이/理) and material force (기/氣)
- Integration of personal morality with social responsibility

2. KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Must include virtues that bridge both personal cultivation and social harmony
- Should reflect the distinctive Korean interpretation of Neo-Confucian thought
- Need to capture both the theoretical foundation and practical application
- Should represent both internal cultivation and external manifestation
- Must include virtues that form the basis for other derivative virtues

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
- Some virtues are foundational (like 인/仁, benevolence)
- Others are methodological (like 경/敬, reverence)
- Some are manifestational (like 예/禮, propriety)
- Others serve as bridging concepts between internal and external cultivation

4. HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
- Focus on virtues emphasized in major Korean Neo-Confucian debates
- Consider virtues particularly stressed in Korean scholarly traditions
- Include virtues that were central to social organization in Joseon Korea

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of the most representative virtues:

1. 인(仁) - Benevolence/Humaneness
- Foundational virtue from which others derive
- Central to Korean Neo-Confucian understanding of human nature

2. 경(敬) - Reverence/Serious Attention
- Distinctively emphasized in Korean tradition
- Key methodological virtue for self-cultivation

3. 성(誠) - Sincerity/Authenticity
- Bridge between internal cultivation and external manifestation
- Essential for genuine moral development

4. 예(禮) - Propriety/Ritual
- External manifestation of internal cultivation
- Social harmonizing function

5. 의(義) - Righteousness
- Moral discernment and judgment
- Basis for proper action

6. 지(智) - Wisdom
- Integration of knowledge and practice
- Essential for moral decision-making

7. 효(孝) - Filial Piety
- Fundamental social virtue
- Basis for extending moral behavior to broader society

8. 중(中) - Balance/Mean
- Core principle of self-regulation
- Essential for harmonizing different aspects of cultivation

9. 수양(修養) - Self-cultivation
- Meta-virtue encompassing the process of moral development
- Distinctively emphasized in Korean tradition

These nine virtues form an interconnected system where:
- 인 provides the foundation
- 경 and 성 provide the method
- 예 and 의 guide external manifestation
- 지 enables proper judgment
- 효 grounds social relations
- 중 ensures balance
- 수양 encompasses the overall process

This selection captures both the theoretical depth and practical orientation of Korean Neo-Confucianism while highlighting its distinctive characteristics and contributions to Confucian thought.
