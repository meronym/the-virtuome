DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF KOREAN NEO-CONFUCIANISM:\n- Strong emphasis on the Four-Seven Debate (\uc0ac\ub2e8\uce60\uc815\ub860) - relationship between moral emotions and human nature\n- Focus on practical self-cultivation rather than purely theoretical discussion\n- Particular attention to the role of reverence (\uacbd/\u656c) in moral development\n- Balance between principle (\uc774/\u7406) and material force (\uae30/\u6c23)\n- Integration of personal morality with social responsibility\n\n2. KEY CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Must include virtues that bridge both personal cultivation and social harmony\n- Should reflect the distinctive Korean interpretation of Neo-Confucian thought\n- Need to capture both the theoretical foundation and practical application\n- Should represent both internal cultivation and external manifestation\n- Must include virtues that form the basis for other derivative virtues\n\n3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:\n- Some virtues are foundational (like \uc778/\u4ec1, benevolence)\n- Others are methodological (like \uacbd/\u656c, reverence)\n- Some are manifestational (like \uc608/\u79ae, propriety)\n- Others serve as bridging concepts between internal and external cultivation\n\n4. HISTORICAL CONTEXT:\n- Focus on virtues emphasized in major Korean Neo-Confucian debates\n- Consider virtues particularly stressed in Korean scholarly traditions\n- Include virtues that were central to social organization in Joseon Korea\n\nBased on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of the most representative virtues:\n\n1. \uc778(\u4ec1) - Benevolence/Humaneness\n- Foundational virtue from which others derive\n- Central to Korean Neo-Confucian understanding of human nature\n\n2. \uacbd(\u656c) - Reverence/Serious Attention\n- Distinctively emphasized in Korean tradition\n- Key methodological virtue for self-cultivation\n\n3. \uc131(\u8aa0) - Sincerity/Authenticity\n- Bridge between internal cultivation and external manifestation\n- Essential for genuine moral development\n\n4. \uc608(\u79ae) - Propriety/Ritual\n- External manifestation of internal cultivation\n- Social harmonizing function\n\n5. \uc758(\u7fa9) - Righteousness\n- Moral discernment and judgment\n- Basis for proper action\n\n6. \uc9c0(\u667a) - Wisdom\n- Integration of knowledge and practice\n- Essential for moral decision-making\n\n7. \ud6a8(\u5b5d) - Filial Piety\n- Fundamental social virtue\n- Basis for extending moral behavior to broader society\n\n8. \uc911(\u4e2d) - Balance/Mean\n- Core principle of self-regulation\n- Essential for harmonizing different aspects of cultivation\n\n9. \uc218\uc591(\u4fee\u990a) - Self-cultivation\n- Meta-virtue encompassing the process of moral development\n- Distinctively emphasized in Korean tradition\n\nThese nine virtues form an interconnected system where:\n- \uc778 provides the foundation\n- \uacbd and \uc131 provide the method\n- \uc608 and \uc758 guide external manifestation\n- \uc9c0 enables proper judgment\n- \ud6a8 grounds social relations\n- \uc911 ensures balance\n- \uc218\uc591 encompasses the overall process\n\nThis selection captures both the theoretical depth and practical orientation of Korean Neo-Confucianism while highlighting its distinctive characteristics and contributions to Confucian thought.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these virtues?"
