Let me think about this systematically:

ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK:
1. Chinese Buddhism represents a unique synthesis where Indian Buddhist concepts were transformed through Chinese cultural and philosophical lenses. The most representative virtues should reflect:
- The core Buddhist path of liberation
- Distinctively Chinese interpretations and emphases
- Practical applicability in daily life
- Integration of meditation and social engagement

2. Key considerations for selection:
- Historical importance in texts and teachings
- Centrality to practice traditions
- Distinctive Chinese Buddhist interpretation
- Influence on broader Chinese culture
- Contemporary relevance

3. Organizing principles to consider:
- Balance between wisdom and compassion aspects
- Integration of meditation and action
- Harmony of sudden and gradual approaches
- Unity of individual and collective cultivation

4. After reflection, I believe the most representative virtues should include:

a) Foundational transformative qualities that enable development
b) Active expressions of realized understanding
c) Integrative virtues that bridge various aspects of practice
d) Social manifestations of Buddhist realization

PROPOSED SHORTLIST (with reasoning):

1. Zhihui (智慧) - Wisdom
- Represents the transformative understanding central to Buddhism
- Chinese interpretation emphasizes practical wisdom in daily life
- Bridges theoretical understanding and lived experience

2. Cibei (慈悲) - Compassion
- Essential counterpart to wisdom

3. Zhengnian (正念) - Right Mindfulness

4. Rongtong (融通) - Integration/Interpenetration

- Key to practical application of Buddhist insights

5. Zizai (自在) - Natural Ease

- Chinese emphasis on uncontrived naturality
- Important Chan Buddhist development

6. Fangbian (方便) - Skillful Means

7. Hexie (和諧) - Harmony

8. Jingzuo (靜慧) - Meditative Wisdom

This selection:
