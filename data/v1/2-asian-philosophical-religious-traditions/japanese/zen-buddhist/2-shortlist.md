Let me think through this systematically:

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:
1. First, I need to consider what makes Zen Buddhism distinct, particularly in its Japanese manifestation
2. Then, identify which virtues are truly central rather than peripheral
3. Consider how these virtues interact and support each other
4. Evaluate which combinations best capture the essence of Zen practice and realization

KEY CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Zen's Distinctive Character:
- Emphasis on direct experience over theoretical understanding
- Integration of practice and everyday life
- Balance of discipline and spontaneity
- Non-dual approach to virtue development
- Embodied rather than purely mental practice

2. Core Principles:
- Practice is enlightenment (修証一如 shushō-ittō)
- Direct pointing to the mind (直指人心 jikishi ninshin)
- Seeing one's true nature (見性 kenshō)
- Everyday mind is the Way (平常心是道 byōjōshin kore dō)

3. Practice Context:
- Meditation as foundational
- Community practice
- Master-disciple relationship
- Daily life activities as practice
- Artistic expressions

4. Development Pattern:
- Initial discipline → Natural expression
- Form → Formlessness
- Effort → Effortlessness
- Personal → Universal
- Conventional → Ultimate

Based on this analysis, I would propose the following shortlist as most representative:

1. Mushin (無心) - No-mind
- Fundamental state of unconditioned awareness
- Transcends dualistic thinking
- Base for spontaneous appropriate action

2. Shikantaza (只管打坐) - Just sitting
- Pure presence
- Complete engagement
- Beyond goal-oriented practice

3. Fudōshin (不動心) - Immovable mind
- Unshakeable stability
- Mental-emotional equilibrium
- Groundedness in practice

4. Gyōji (行持) - Continuous practice
- Sustained dedication
- Integration of practice and daily life
- Moment-to-moment awareness

5. Zuijun (随順) - Harmonious following
- Natural accordance with circumstances
- Responsive adaptation
- Freedom within form

6. Kenshō (見性) - Seeing true nature
- Direct insight
- Experiential wisdom
- Beyond conceptual understanding

7. Samu (作務) - Mindful work
- Practice in action
- Attention to detail
- Sacred ordinary

8. Zanshin (残心) - Continued awareness
- Sustained attention
- Present-moment consciousness
- Complete follow-through

These eight virtues form an interconnected system that:
- Covers both meditative and active aspects
- Includes both foundational and advanced qualities
- Represents both practice and realization
- Encompasses both individual and relational dimensions
- Bridges conventional and ultimate perspectives

They progress from basic practice qualities to more subtle realizations, while maintaining the essential Zen characteristic of being simultaneously practice and goal.

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these eight virtues? Or would you prefer to adjust this selection first?
