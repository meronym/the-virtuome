Let me think about this systematically.

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:

1. KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
- What makes Roman Stoicism distinct from Greek Stoicism
- What virtues were particularly emphasized in the primary texts
- Which virtues were most practically developed and applied
- How these virtues interconnect and support each other
- Their relevance to both personal and public life (important in Roman context)

2. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF ROMAN STOICISM:
- More practical than theoretical
- Emphasis on personal development and self-examination
- Strong focus on duty and public service
- Integration of private virtue and public role
- Importance of resilience in face of political dangers
- Balance between acceptance and active engagement

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
The ideal shortlist should include:
- Foundation virtues (basic building blocks)
- Developmental virtues (tools for growth)
- Expression virtues (how virtue manifests in action)
- Social virtues (interaction with others)
- Leadership virtues (given the Roman context)

4. SYNTHESIS CRITERIA:
- Core importance to the tradition
- Practical applicability
- Interconnectedness with other virtues
- Textual emphasis across multiple authors
- Distinctive Roman development
- Both personal and public relevance
