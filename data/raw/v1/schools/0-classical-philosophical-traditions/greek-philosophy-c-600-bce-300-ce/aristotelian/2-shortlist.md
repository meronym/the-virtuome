Let me think through this systematically.

REASONING FOR SELECTION:

1. FOUNDATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Aristotle's ethics is fundamentally about human flourishing (eudaimonia)
- The system is hierarchical, with some virtues being more fundamental than others
- There's an inherent connection between intellectual and moral virtues
- The practical aim is the development of excellent character

2. KEY SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Centrality to Aristotle's ethical framework
- Foundational role in character development
- Interconnectedness with other virtues
- Practical importance in human flourishing
- Representative of both moral and intellectual domains
- Balance between individual and social aspects

3. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Need to represent both moral and intellectual excellences
- Must include virtues that bridge theory and practice
- Should capture both individual and social dimensions
- Must reflect the developmental nature of virtue

4. PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ASPECTS:
- Phronesis (practical wisdom) is essential as it guides all moral virtues
- Justice has both individual and social dimensions
- Some virtues are more foundational for character development
- Certain virtues are necessary for the development of others

5. SYNTHESIS APPROACH:
The selection should create a coherent system where:
- Each virtue plays a distinct essential role
- Together they enable human flourishing
- They represent both theoretical and practical aspects
- They cover individual and social dimensions
- They enable development of other virtues

Based on this reasoning, here's my proposed shortlist of most representative Aristotelian virtues:

CORE SHORTLIST:

1. Phronesis (Practical Wisdom)
- The master virtue that guides all others
- Bridge between intellectual and moral virtues
- Essential for proper judgment in all situations

2. Sophia (Theoretical Wisdom)
- Highest intellectual virtue
- Represents contemplative excellence
- Goal of philosophical development

3. Dikaiosyne (Justice)
- Complete virtue in relation to others
- Foundations of social and political life
- Both individual and communal aspects

4. Megalopsychia (Magnanimity)
- Crown of the moral virtues
- Represents proper self-evaluation
- Models complete character development

5. Andreia (Courage)
- Fundamental for moral action
- Essential for defending what's right
- Model of the doctrine of the mean

6. Sophrosyne (Temperance)
- Basic self-mastery
- Foundation for other virtues
- Essential for character development

7. Philia (Friendship/Sociability)
- Necessary for human flourishing
- Context for virtue development
- Bridge between individual and community

8. Aletheia (Truthfulness)
- Essential for both theoretical and practical life
- Foundation of intellectual integrity
- Basis for self-knowledge

This selection:
- Covers both intellectual and moral domains
- Includes individual and social dimensions
- Represents different levels of virtue development
- Contains virtues necessary for developing others
- Forms a coherent system for human flourishing
- Captures the essence of Aristotelian virtue ethics

Each of these virtues is both independently important and interconnected with the others, forming a comprehensive framework for human excellence. They represent different aspects of human nature (rational, social, emotional) while maintaining the practical focus on character development that is central to Aristotelian ethics.

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these eight virtues?
