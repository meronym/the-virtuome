CONTEXTUAL ELEMENTS:

- These virtues are understood within:
  * Theory of human nature
  * Doctrine of the mean
  * Concept of eudaimonia (flourishing)
  * Role of habit and practice
  * Importance of good upbringing
  * Social/political context
  * Educational requirements
  * Relationship to pleasure/pain

DEVELOPMENTAL ASPECTS:

- Virtues require:
  * Natural capacity
  * Proper habituation
  * Practical experience
  * Theoretical understanding
  * Social context
  * Good role models
  * Practice over time
  * Reflection and adjustment

This list represents the primary virtues explicit in Aristotle's works and those that can be reasonably inferred from his ethical framework. Each virtue has complex relationships with others and specific contexts for proper expression.

Would you like me to prioritize any particular virtue for detailed YAML node creation, or proceed with creating nodes for a specific subset of these virtues?
