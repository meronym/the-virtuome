Let me think through this carefully.

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:
When distilling Pythagorean virtues, we need to consider several key factors:

1. FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES
The Pythagorean tradition was fundamentally about:
- Achieving harmony with the cosmic order
- Understanding reality through mathematics
- Purifying body and soul
- Developing wisdom through disciplined practice
- Building a virtuous community

2. HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE
Their teaching system was hierarchical:
- Beginning with basic disciplines (silence, obedience)
- Progressing to mathematical understanding
- Culminating in cosmic/divine wisdom

3. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES
What makes Pythagorean virtue ethics unique:
- Integration of mathematical and moral truth
- Emphasis on harmony at all levels
- Strong communal aspect
- Union of practical and contemplative virtues
- Focus on systematic development

4. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION
They believed virtues must be:
- Actively practiced daily
- Developed systematically
- Verified through community
- Demonstrated in concrete ways
- Connected to cosmic principles

5. TRANSFORMATIVE GOAL
The ultimate aim was:
- Complete harmony of individual with cosmos
- Integration of theoretical and practical wisdom
- Achievement of divine understanding
- Perfection of human nature
- Service to community

Based on this analysis, I would propose the following shortlist of core Pythagorean virtues, arranged in a developmental sequence:

PROPOSED SHORTLIST:

1. Echemythia (Disciplined Silence)
- Foundation of all learning
- First step in transformation
- Demonstrates self-control and receptivity

2. Sophrosyne (Temperance)
- Mastery of passions
- Balance in all things
- Bridge between physical and spiritual

3. Harmonia (Harmony)
- Understanding and embodying cosmic order
- Integration of opposites
- Mathematical-musical wisdom

4. Katharotes (Purity)
- Physical and spiritual cleanliness
- Clarity of thought and action
- Prerequisite for higher knowledge

5. Philomathia (Love of Learning)
- Dedication to understanding
- Mathematical insight
- Progressive development

6. Dikaiosyne (Justice)
- Mathematical equality
- Fair relationships
- Cosmic balance

7. Philia (Sacred Friendship)
- Community bonds
- Shared wisdom
- Mutual development

8. Sophia (Divine Wisdom)
- Ultimate understanding
- Integration of all virtues
- Cosmic consciousness

This shortlist represents:
- A developmental progression
- Integration of practical and theoretical
- Balance of individual and communal
- Connection of human to cosmic
- Unique Pythagorean emphasis on mathematical-moral unity

Each virtue builds on the previous ones while maintaining the distinctive Pythagorean integration of:
- Mathematical understanding
- Moral development
- Practical discipline
- Communal life
- Cosmic harmony

Does this analysis and shortlist capture the essence you're looking for? Would you like me to adjust the selection or proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these virtues?
