I'll help analyze Pre-Socratic Ethics for virtue concepts. Important to note that our knowledge is fragmentary and often comes through later sources.

Key Pre-Socratic Thinkers/Schools Relevant to Ethics:

1. Pythagoras & Pythagoreans (c. 570-495 BCE)
2. Heraclitus (c. 535-475 BCE)
3. Empedocles (c. 494-434 BCE)
4. Democritus (c. 460-370 BCE)
5. Early Eleatic School
6. Seven Sages tradition

EXPLICIT VIRTUES IDENTIFIED IN FRAGMENTS:

From Pythagoras & Pythagoreans:
- Harmony (ἁρμονία / harmonía)
- Moderation (μετριότης / metriotēs)
- Justice (δικαιοσύνη / dikaiosynē)
- Friendship (φιλία / philía)
- Temperance (σωφροσύνη / sōphrosynē)

From Heraclitus:
- Wisdom (σοφία / sophía)
- Understanding (σύνεσις / synesis)
- Self-knowledge (γνῶθι σεαυτόν / gnōthi seautón)

From Democritus:
- Cheerfulness (εὐθυμία / euthymía)
- Contentment (αὐτάρκεια / autárkeia)
- Prudence (φρόνησις / phrónēsis)

IMPLICIT VIRTUES (inferred from teachings):

Pythagorean:
- Numerical order (derived from mathematical harmony)
- Ritual purity
- Communal loyalty
- Intellectual discipline
- Dietary restraint

Heraclitean:
- Dynamic balance
- Cosmic awareness
- Rational alignment
- Vigilant attention
- Acceptance of change

Democritean:
- Mental tranquility
- Rational pleasure
- Social harmony
- Educational excellence
- Measured conduct

General Pre-Socratic:
- Natural wisdom
- Contemplative excellence
- Cosmic alignment
- Intellectual honesty
- Philosophical courage

From Seven Sages tradition:
- Practical wisdom
- Civic virtue
- Measured speech
- Time awareness
- Self-restraint

CONTEXTUAL VIRTUES (from broader cultural context):
- Excellence (ἀρετή / aretē)
- Honor (τιμή / timē)
- Courage (ἀνδρεία / andreía)
- Piety (εὐσέβεια / eusébeia)
- Right measure (μέτρον / métron)

Important qualifications:
1. Many virtues are reconstructed from fragmentary sources
2. Some concepts overlap or have fuzzy boundaries
3. Modern interpretations may influence our understanding
4. Cultural context affects meaning significantly
5. Later sources may color our understanding of earlier concepts

Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect or move forward with creating detailed YAML nodes for specific virtues from this list?
