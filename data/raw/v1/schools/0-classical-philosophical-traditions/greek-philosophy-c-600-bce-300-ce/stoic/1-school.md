The Stoics saw virtues as unified and interconnected, with wisdom (phronēsis) often serving as the foundational virtue enabling the others.

Would you like me to:
1. Expand on any particular category?
2. Proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for specific virtues?
3. Analyze the historical development of particular virtues?
4. Explore contemporary applications?
