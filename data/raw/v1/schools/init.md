I am ready to begin the systematic analysis and documentation of human virtues across traditions. I will proceed methodically through each tradition listed in the scope, creating detailed YAML+Markdown entries for each virtue following the specified format.

Would you like me to:
1. Start with a particular tradition
2. Begin chronologically with the earliest traditions
3. Follow the order as presented in the scope outline
4. Focus on a specific virtue across multiple traditions

Please indicate your preference for how to proceed.

I will maintain careful attention to:
- Accurate transliteration and original scripts
- Historical context and development
- Inter-traditional connections
- Practical applications
- Cultural nuances and authenticity

Each entry will be thoroughly researched within my training data and formatted according to the provided template.

How would you like to proceed?
