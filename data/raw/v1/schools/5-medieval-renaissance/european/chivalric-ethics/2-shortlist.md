Let me think through this systematically.

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:
1. Core Considerations:
- Which virtues appear most frequently in primary sources?
- Which virtues are treated as foundational or generative of others?
- Which virtues uniquely characterize chivalric ethics vs. other medieval virtue systems?
- Which virtues bridge multiple domains (martial, spiritual, social)?

2. Historical Development:
The chivalric tradition evolved from primarily martial origins to incorporate:
- Christian religious elements
- Courtly social refinements
- Literary/romantic ideals
This suggests we need virtues representing each developmental layer while focusing on those that achieved synthesis.

3. Practical Impact:
The most essential virtues should:
- Guide both practical conduct and ideal aspiration
- Bridge internal character and external behavior
- Apply across multiple contexts (battlefield, court, private life)
- Support both individual excellence and social harmony

4. Cultural Distinctiveness:
The uniquely chivalric contribution to virtue ethics lies in:
- Synthesis of warrior ethics with Christian morality
- Integration of martial prowess with social refinement
- Balance of strength with gentleness
- Combination of practical skill with moral excellence

5. Legacy and Influence:
The most enduring virtues were those that:
- Transcended their historical context
- Influenced later ethical traditions
- Remained relevant to personal development
- Offered universal human insights

Based on this analysis, I propose the following shortlist as most representative:

CORE CHIVALRIC VIRTUES:

1. PROWESS (Prouesse)
- Represents excellence in action
- Combines physical skill with moral purpose
- Foundation for earning right to exercise other virtues

2. HONOR (Honneur)
- Integrates personal integrity with social reputation
- Links individual conscience with communal standards
- Central to chivalric self-regulation

3. COURTESY (Courtoisie)
- Elevates strength through refinement
- Bridges martial and social virtues
- Humanizes power through grace

4. LOYALTY (Loyaut√©)
- Structures relationships and obligations
- Provides framework for service
- Balances individual excellence with social duty

5. LARGESSE
- Demonstrates nobility through generosity
- Links material power with moral responsibility
- Practical expression of social virtue

6. FRANCHISE
- Represents noble-minded authenticity
- Combines freedom with responsibility
- Balances power with ethical constraint

7. MESURE
- Controls and directs other virtues
- Provides wisdom in application
- Balances competing demands

8. PREUDOMME
- Represents integrated excellence
- Combines experience with wisdom
- Ultimate goal of chivalric development

This shortlist:
- Covers major domains (martial, social, moral)
- Includes both practical and aspirational virtues
- Represents different stages of tradition's development
- Maintains internal relationships between virtues
- Captures distinctive chivalric synthesis

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML+Markdown nodes for these eight core virtues?
