Let me think through this systematically.

REASONING PROCESS:

1. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS
- Scholastic ethics was fundamentally a synthesis of Classical (particularly Aristotelian) and Christian thought
- It aimed to reconcile reason and faith
- It was hierarchically organized, with some virtues seen as foundational to others

2. HISTORICAL CONTEXT
- Developed in medieval universities and monasteries
- Served both educational and spiritual formation
- Needed to address both contemplative and active life
- Balanced individual perfection with social harmony

3. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES
- Integration of natural and supernatural virtues
- Emphasis on rational understanding of moral life
- Strong focus on practical wisdom in moral decisions
- Recognition of both acquired and infused virtues

4. SELECTION CRITERIA:
I'll prioritize virtues that:
- Were extensively discussed in major texts
- Served as linking concepts between different aspects of moral life
- Remained influential beyond their historical context
- Represented unique scholastic developments
- Addressed both theoretical and practical aspects
- Connected individual and communal dimensions

5. STRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION:
The selection should reflect the scholastic understanding of:
- The relationship between intellect and will
- The connection between contemplative and active life
- The integration of natural and supernatural elements
- The progression from basic to higher virtues

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of most representative virtues:

CORE REPRESENTATIVE VIRTUES:

1. PRUDENTIA (Prudence/Practical Wisdom)
- Bridges theoretical and practical knowledge
- Guides all other moral virtues
- Central to moral decision-making
- Links reason and virtue

2. CARITAS (Charity/Divine Love)
- Highest theological virtue
- Perfects all other virtues
- Links human and divine
- Unifies contemplative and active life

3. SAPIENTIA (Wisdom)
- Integrates faith and reason
- Highest intellectual virtue
- Orders all knowledge to ultimate ends
- Guides contemplative life

4. IUSTITIA (Justice)
- Primary social virtue
- Orders human relationships
- Links individual and community
- Foundation of moral order

5. RATIO RECTA (Right Reason)
- Fundamental to moral understanding
- Guides moral judgment
- Integrates faith and rationality
- Essential for virtue development

6. STUDIOSITAS (Studiousness)
- Distinctively scholastic virtue
- Moderates desire for knowledge
- Bridges intellectual and moral virtues
- Essential for self-formation

7. DISCRETIO (Discernment)
- Practical application of wisdom
- Guides moral choices
- Balances extremes
- Essential for moral life

8. DOCILITAS (Teachability)
- Essential for intellectual and moral growth
- Enables virtue acquisition
- Supports wisdom development
- Foundational for education

9. PIETAS (Piety)
- Links natural and supernatural
- Orders human relationships
- Grounds moral life
- Integrates devotion and reason

This selection captures the essential elements of scholastic virtue ethics while reflecting its distinctive synthesis of classical and Christian thought. Each virtue serves multiple functions in the moral life and connects different aspects of human development.

The list maintains internal coherence while covering the major dimensions of scholastic ethics: intellectual, moral, theological, practical, and social. It also reflects the scholastic concern with both the theoretical understanding and practical development of virtue.

Do you want me to elaborate on any of these virtues or explain their relationships in more detail?
