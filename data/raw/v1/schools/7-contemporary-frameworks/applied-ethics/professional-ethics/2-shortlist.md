Let me think through this systematically:

REASONING PROCESS:

1. CORE CRITERIA FOR SELECTION:
- Universal applicability across professional domains
- Historical persistence and contemporary relevance
- Fundamental rather than derivative nature
- Direct connection to character development
- Practical impact on professional conduct

2. KEY CONSIDERATIONS:

a) Professional ethics uniquely bridges:
- Individual character and institutional roles
- Personal development and public service
- Technical expertise and moral wisdom
- Specific duties and universal principles

b) The tradition particularly emphasizes:
- The relationship between competence and character
- The balance of autonomy and accountability
- The integration of expertise and ethical judgment
- The dual responsibility to client and society

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Most professional virtues seem to cluster around three core dimensions:
- Excellence (technical/practical mastery)
- Ethics (moral conduct)
- Service (professional purpose)

4. DEVELOPMENTAL PERSPECTIVE:
The most fundamental virtues should:
- Enable other virtuous practices
- Foster professional growth
- Guide decision-making
- Support adaptation to new challenges

Based on this analysis, I propose this synthesized shortlist:

CORE PROFESSIONAL VIRTUES:

1. Professional Integrity
- The foundational virtue integrating personal character with professional role
- Encompasses truthfulness, consistency, and moral courage
- Enables trust-based professional relationships

2. Professional Wisdom (Practical Judgment)
- The capacity to apply knowledge appropriately in complex situations
- Combines technical expertise with ethical discernment
- Develops through experience and reflection

3. Stewardship
- Responsible care for profession, clients, and society
- Long-term perspective on professional impact
- Environmental and social responsibility

4. Beneficence
- Active promotion of good through professional practice
- Balance of client interest and public good
- Commitment to positive impact

5. Professional Excellence
- Continuous development of competence
- Integration of technical and ethical mastery
- Commitment to best practices

6. Collegiality
- Collaborative practice and mutual support
- Knowledge sharing and mentorship
- Professional community building

7. Professional Autonomy
- Independent judgment within ethical constraints
- Resistance to improper influence
- Maintenance of professional standards

8. Service Orientation
- Priority of client/public welfare
- Commitment to accessibility
- Professional altruism

9. Accountability
- Professional responsibility
- Transparency in practice
- Acceptance of scrutiny

10. Adaptive Expertise
- Continuous learning
- Innovation within ethical bounds
- Response to changing contexts

This list attempts to capture the essential virtues that:
- Form the foundation for professional character
- Enable ethical practice across domains
- Support professional development
- Guide response to new challenges
- Maintain professional standards
- Serve professional purpose

Each virtue is fundamentally linked to character development while having clear practical applications. They are mutually reinforcing and together create a framework for professional excellence that balances individual development with social responsibility.

Would you like me to:
1. Elaborate on any of these virtues?
2. Explain their interrelationships?
3. Proceed with creating YAML nodes for them?
4. Reconsider the selection based on additional criteria?
