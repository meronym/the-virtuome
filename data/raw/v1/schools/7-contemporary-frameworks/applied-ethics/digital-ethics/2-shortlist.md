Let me think through this systematically.

REASONING PROCESS:

1. KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Digital ethics is fundamentally about human behavior and character in technologically-mediated environments
- The core virtues should address both individual and collective flourishing
- They should be applicable across changing technological landscapes
- They should connect to traditional virtue ethics while addressing novel challenges

2. FILTERING CRITERIA:
- Foundational importance (how central is it to digital ethics?)
- Distinctiveness (what makes it uniquely relevant to digital contexts?)
- Scope of impact (how broadly applicable is it?)
- Contemporary relevance (how crucial is it for current challenges?)
- Future resilience (will it remain relevant as technology evolves?)

3. THEMATIC ANALYSIS:
The most essential virtues should address:
- Individual character development in digital contexts
- Responsible relationship with technology
- Ethical interaction with others through digital means
- Stewardship of digital resources and environments
- Wisdom in navigating novel ethical challenges

4. SYNTHESIS APPROACH:
Looking for virtues that:
- Have deep philosophical roots but clear digital applications
- Bridge personal and collective ethical concerns
- Address both immediate and long-term challenges
- Combine practical and aspirational elements
- Support human flourishing in increasingly digital contexts

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of core digital virtues:

1. DIGITAL WISDOM (σοφία ψηφιακή)
- The capacity to make sound judgments about the use, impact, and development of digital technologies
- Combines traditional philosophical wisdom with technological understanding
- Foundation for all other digital virtues

2. CYBER-PRUDENCE (φρόνησις κυβερνητική)
- Practical wisdom in navigating digital spaces and making technology decisions
- Bridges theoretical understanding and practical application
- Essential for daily digital life

3. NETWORK INTEGRITY (ἦθος δικτυακό)
- Maintaining authentic and ethical presence across digital networks
- Encompasses truthfulness, consistency, and moral uprightness
- Core to digital identity and relationships

4. DIGITAL TEMPERANCE (σωφροσύνη ψηφιακή)
- Balanced, mindful relationship with technology
- Self-regulation in digital consumption and interaction
- Critical for psychological well-being

5. TECHNOLOGICAL EMPATHY (συμπάθεια τεχνολογική)
- Understanding and considering human impacts of technical decisions
- Maintaining human connection through digital mediation
- Essential for ethical design and interaction

6. DATA STEWARDSHIP (ἐπιτροπεία δεδομένων)
- Responsible management of information and digital resources
- Encompasses privacy, security, and sustainability
- Critical for trust and system integrity

7. ALGORITHMIC HUMILITY (ταπεινοφροσύνη ἀλγοριθμική)
- Recognition of limitations in computational solutions
- Balance between technological capability and human wisdom
- Important for responsible innovation

8. DIGITAL COURAGE (ἀνδρεία ψηφιακή)
- Standing up for right principles in digital contexts
- Taking responsible risks for ethical technology
- Necessary for ethical leadership

9. NETWORK JUSTICE (δικαιοσύνη δικτυακή)
- Ensuring fairness and equity in digital systems
- Addressing systematic biases and exclusions
- Foundation for ethical digital society

These virtues form an interconnected system where:
- Digital Wisdom and Cyber-Prudence guide overall behavior
- Network Integrity and Digital Temperance govern personal conduct
- Technological Empathy and Data Stewardship guide relationship with others/data
- Algorithmic Humility informs development and innovation
- Digital Courage enables ethical action
- Network Justice ensures systemic fairness

This framework:
- Addresses both individual and collective ethical concerns
- Spans immediate practical needs and long-term aspirations
- Connects to traditional virtue ethics while addressing novel challenges
- Remains relevant across technological changes
- Supports human flourishing in digital contexts

Would you like me to:
1. Elaborate on any particular virtue?
2. Explore the relationships between these virtues?
3. Begin creating detailed YAML nodes for these core virtues?
4. Analyze their historical development or practical applications?
