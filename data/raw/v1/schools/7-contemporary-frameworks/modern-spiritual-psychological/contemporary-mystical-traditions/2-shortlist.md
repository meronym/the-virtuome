Let me think through this systematically.

ANALYTICAL PROCESS:

1. Core Characteristics of Contemporary Mystical Traditions:
- Integration of ancient wisdom with modern understanding
- Emphasis on both individual and collective transformation
- Balance of transcendence and embodiment
- Focus on practical application
- Recognition of evolutionary development

2. Key Selection Criteria:
- Must represent both personal and collective dimensions
- Should bridge contemplative and active aspects
- Need to include both traditional mystical qualities and contemporary evolutionary elements
- Should reflect both being-qualities and becoming-qualities
- Must be practically applicable while maintaining depth

3. Structural Considerations:
- Need virtues that support foundation/ground
- Need virtues that facilitate transformation
- Need virtues that enable integration
- Need virtues that promote service/contribution
- Need virtues that support collective evolution

4. Integration Patterns:
- Individual ↔ Collective
- Being ↔ Becoming
- Wisdom ↔ Practice
- Transcendence ↔ Embodiment
- Personal ↔ Universal

REASONING FOR FINAL SELECTION:

I believe the most representative virtues should:
- Form a coherent developmental sequence
- Support both individual and collective evolution
- Bridge contemplative wisdom and active engagement
- Enable practical transformation while maintaining depth
- Support both personal realization and global contribution

Based on this analysis, here is my proposed shortlist of the most representative virtues:

1. Presence
(Foundation: capacity for direct, embodied awareness of what is)

2. Witnessing Consciousness
(Meta-awareness: ability to observe without identification)

3. Integral Discernment
(Wisdom: capacity to navigate multiple perspectives and levels of reality)

4. Sacred Embodiment
(Integration: full embodiment of awareness in form)

5. Evolutionary Love
(Motivation: transpersonal care driving development)

6. Creative Response-ability
(Action: capacity for wise, spontaneous engagement)

7. Collective Intelligence
(Relationship: ability to participate in emergent group wisdom)

8. Transformational Readiness
(Development: openness to continuous evolution)

9. Global Awareness
(Context: recognition of planetary/universal interconnection)

This selection:
- Covers the full spectrum from individual to collective
- Includes both being-qualities and becoming-qualities
- Supports both realization and transformation
- Enables both wisdom and practical engagement
- Addresses both personal and universal dimensions

Each virtue builds upon and supports the others, forming an integrated system that represents the essential qualities needed for contemporary mystical development while maintaining practical applicability.

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these virtues, or would you prefer to refine this selection further?
