Let me analyze what makes Integral Theory distinctive in its approach to human virtues and development:

KEY CONSIDERATIONS:

1. META-FRAMEWORK NATURE
- Integral Theory is unique in that it's a meta-framework that attempts to include and transcend other frameworks
- Virtues should reflect this integrative, meta-systematic quality

2. DEVELOPMENTAL PERSPECTIVE
- Strong emphasis on stage development and evolution
- Virtues should capture both developmental capacity and developmental process

3. QUADRANT INTEGRATION
- Balance of interior/exterior and individual/collective dimensions
- Key virtues should represent all quadrants (I, We, It, Its)

4. THEORY/PRACTICE BALANCE
- Strong emphasis on practical application through Integral Life Practice
- Virtues should reflect both understanding and embodiment

5. EVOLUTIONARY CONTEXT
- Focus on evolution of consciousness and culture
- Virtues should capture both personal and collective evolution

SELECTION CRITERIA:

1. Representativeness
- Must capture essential aspects of integral thinking
- Should reflect multiple dimensions of the framework

2. Distinctiveness
- Should highlight what makes Integral Theory unique
- Should reflect its meta-systematic nature

3. Practicality
- Must be applicable in real-world development
- Should be recognizable in practice

4. Development Focus
- Should capture both states and stages
- Must reflect evolutionary capacity

5. Integration
- Should demonstrate integrative capacity
- Must reflect multiple perspectives

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of core Integral virtues:

1. INTEGRAL AWARENESS
- The meta-capacity to hold multiple perspectives
- Foundation for all other integral virtues
- Reflects the core integrative nature of the approach

2. DEVELOPMENTAL WISDOM
- Understanding and facilitating growth processes
- Both personal and collective development
- Including stage awareness and evolutionary capacity

3. QUADRATIC PRESENCE
- Balanced attention to all four quadrants
- Integration of subjective/objective and individual/collective
- Practical embodiment of integral theory

4. SHADOW INTEGRATION
- Active engagement with unconscious material
- Personal and collective shadow work
- Essential for genuine development

5. STATE-STAGE FLUIDITY
- Navigation of different states of consciousness
- Integration of developmental stages
- Balance of being and becoming

6. EVOLUTIONARY STEWARDSHIP
- Conscious participation in evolution
- Individual and collective responsibility
- Future-oriented ethical awareness

7. PRACTICE INTEGRITY
- Commitment to integral life practice
- Balance of multiple training modalities
- Theory-practice integration

8. META-SYSTEMATIC COGNITION
- Complex systems understanding
- Integration of multiple paradigms
- Vision-logic capacity

9. PERSPECTIVAL AGILITY
- Flexibility in taking multiple perspectives
- Integration of different worldviews
- Cultural intelligence

These nine virtues capture the essential aspects of Integral Theory while maintaining its distinctive features:
- They span all quadrants
- They include both states and stages
- They reflect both theory and practice
- They capture both individual and collective dimensions
- They emphasize both understanding and embodiment

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML+Markdown nodes for these core virtues?
