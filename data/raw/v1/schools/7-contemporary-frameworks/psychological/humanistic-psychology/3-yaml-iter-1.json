AUTHENTICITY\n- Central organizing virtue\n- Integrates self-awareness, congruence, and genuine expression\n- Foundation for all other virtuous development\n\n2. ACTUALIZING TENDENCY\n- The fundamental growth orientation\n- Includes drive toward potential, development, and integration\n- Represents the dynamic aspect of virtue\n\n3. EXPERIENTIAL OPENNESS\n- Receptivity to internal and external experience\n- Includes mindful awareness and present-centeredness\n- Foundation for growth and change\n\n4. UNCONDITIONAL POSITIVE REGARD\n- Core relational virtue\n- Includes acceptance, non-judgment, and profound respect\n- Essential for both self and other relationships\n\n5. EMPATHIC UNDERSTANDING\n- Deep emotional-cognitive comprehension\n- Bridges self and other\n- Essential for meaningful relationships\n\n6. MEANING-ORIENTATION\n- Existential dimension\n- Includes purpose-finding and value-creation\n- Links individual growth to larger context\n\n7. INTEGRATIVE WHOLENESS\n- Synthesis of various aspects of self\n- Balance of thinking, feeling, and acting\n- Resolution of polarities\n\n8. CREATIVE EXPRESSION\n- Manifestation of unique potential\n- Includes both artistic and life creativity\n- Bridge between inner experience and outer manifestation\n\nThis list captures the essential virtues that:\n- Form the foundation of humanistic psychology's approach to human development\n- Represent both personal and interpersonal dimensions\n- Include both state-like and trait-like qualities\n- Cover the main domains of human experience\n- Form an interconnected system of virtue development\n\nEach virtue can be seen as both a goal and a process, reflecting the humanistic emphasis on both being and becoming.
