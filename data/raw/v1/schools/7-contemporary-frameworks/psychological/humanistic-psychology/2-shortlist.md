Let me think through this carefully.

REASONING PROCESS:

1. CORE PRINCIPLES OF HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY:
- Focus on human potential and growth
- Emphasis on present experience and awareness
- Integration of whole person (thoughts, feelings, actions)
- Importance of authentic self-expression
- Centrality of meaningful relationships

2. UNIQUE CONTRIBUTIONS TO VIRTUE THEORY:
- Shift from pathology to potential
- Integration of being and becoming
- Balance of self-development and interpersonal connection
- Emphasis on experiential authenticity
- Focus on self-actualization as virtue development

3. SELECTION CRITERIA:
a) Historical significance within the tradition
b) Theoretical centrality
c) Practical applicability
d) Distinctiveness from other traditions
e) Integration of multiple aspects

4. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Need to represent both personal and interpersonal domains
- Include both state-like and trait-like virtues
- Cover cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions
- Reflect both "being" and "becoming" aspects
- Include both process and outcome virtues

5. SYNTHESIS REQUIREMENTS:
- Virtues should be interconnected
- Each should represent a cluster of related concepts
- Together should form a coherent system
- Must reflect the developmental nature of the tradition

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of the most representative virtues:

CORE HUMANISTIC VIRTUES:

1. AUTHENTICITY
- Central organizing virtue
- Integrates self-awareness, congruence, and genuine expression
- Foundation for all other virtuous development

2. ACTUALIZING TENDENCY
- The fundamental growth orientation
- Includes drive toward potential, development, and integration
- Represents the dynamic aspect of virtue

3. EXPERIENTIAL OPENNESS
- Receptivity to internal and external experience
- Includes mindful awareness and present-centeredness
- Foundation for growth and change

4. UNCONDITIONAL POSITIVE REGARD
- Core relational virtue
- Includes acceptance, non-judgment, and profound respect
- Essential for both self and other relationships

5. EMPATHIC UNDERSTANDING
- Deep emotional-cognitive comprehension
- Bridges self and other
- Essential for meaningful relationships

6. MEANING-ORIENTATION
- Existential dimension
- Includes purpose-finding and value-creation
- Links individual growth to larger context

7. INTEGRATIVE WHOLENESS
- Synthesis of various aspects of self
- Balance of thinking, feeling, and acting
- Resolution of polarities

8. CREATIVE EXPRESSION
- Manifestation of unique potential
- Includes both artistic and life creativity
- Bridge between inner experience and outer manifestation

This list captures the essential virtues that:
- Form the foundation of humanistic psychology's approach to human development
- Represent both personal and interpersonal dimensions
- Include both state-like and trait-like qualities
- Cover the main domains of human experience
- Form an interconnected system of virtue development

Each virtue can be seen as both a goal and a process, reflecting the humanistic emphasis on both being and becoming. Together, they create a framework for understanding and developing human potential in a way that is distinctly humanistic while remaining practically applicable.

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these core virtues?
