Let me think through this systematically.

REASONING PROCESS:

1. CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF MORAL PSYCHOLOGY:
- Empirically grounded
- Development-focused
- Integrates cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects
- Considers both universal and culturally-specific elements
- Emphasizes practical application and measurable outcomes

2. KEY SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Must be well-researched with empirical support
- Should span different domains of moral functioning
- Must reflect both individual and social dimensions
- Should represent both innate capacities and developed abilities
- Must be malleable/developable through intervention
- Should have clear behavioral manifestations

3. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Need to include foundational capacities that enable moral behavior
- Should represent both automatic/intuitive and deliberative processes
- Must acknowledge both emotional and rational components
- Should include both self-oriented and other-oriented virtues
- Must reflect both universal and contextual aspects

4. SYNTHESIS APPROACH:
Looking for virtues that:
- Appear across multiple research programs
- Have strong empirical support
- Show clear developmental trajectories
- Demonstrate practical importance
- Connect to real-world outcomes

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of most representative virtues:

CORE REPRESENTATIVE VIRTUES:

1. MORAL SENSITIVITY
- Foundation for moral awareness and recognition
- Combines emotional and cognitive elements
- Developmentally primary
- Essential for all other moral functioning

2. EMPATHIC COMPETENCE
- Integrates cognitive and emotional empathy
- Well-researched developmental trajectory
- Critical for prosocial behavior
- Links individual to social morality

3. MORAL REASONING
- Represents deliberative moral capacity
- Shows clear developmental stages
- Bridges intuition and judgment
- Essential for complex moral decisions

4. ETHICAL WISDOM
- Integrates experience and knowledge
- Combines automatic and reflective processes
- Develops through learning and practice
- Enables contextual application

5. MORAL COURAGE
- Links judgment to action
- Requires integration of multiple capacities
- Shows clear behavioral manifestation
- Critical for moral implementation

6. INTEGRITY
- Represents moral coherence
- Integrates values and behavior
- Develops through consistent practice
- Essential for moral character

7. MORAL SELF-REGULATION
- Controls moral behavior

This list represents:
- Both foundational capacities and developed abilities
- Integration of emotional and rational elements
- Coverage of individual and social dimensions
- Balance of universal and contextual aspects
- Clear developmental pathways
- Strong empirical support
- Practical applicability

Each virtue:
- Has clear empirical research behind it
- Shows developmental progression
- Can be cultivated through intervention
- Has measurable outcomes
- Connects to real-world behavior

Would you like me to:
1. Elaborate on any particular virtue?
2. Explain the interrelationships between these virtues?
3. Proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these core virtues?
