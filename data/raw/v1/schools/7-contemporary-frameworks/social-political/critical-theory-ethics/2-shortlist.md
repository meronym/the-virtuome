Let me think through this systematically.

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:
To distill the most representative virtues of Critical Theory Ethics, I'll consider:

1. CORE MISSION
Critical Theory's fundamental aim is the emancipation from all forms of domination and the creation of a more just society through critical awareness and transformative action.

2. METHODOLOGICAL ESSENTIALS
- The unity of theory and practice (praxis)
- Interdisciplinary analysis
- Self-reflexive critique
- Emancipatory orientation

3. KEY CRITERIA FOR SELECTION:
a) The virtue should contribute directly to the emancipatory project
b) It should bridge individual and collective transformation
c) It should integrate cognitive, emotional, and practical dimensions
d) It should reflect both critical and constructive aspects
e) It should connect theory with lived experience

4. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES:
What makes Critical Theory Ethics unique is its:
- Integration of social analysis with moral philosophy
- Focus on structural transformation through individual and collective action
- Emphasis on consciousness and recognition
- Commitment to practical change
- Dialectical understanding of reality

REASONING FOR SHORTLIST:

1. We need virtues that capture both the ANALYTICAL and TRANSFORMATIVE aspects of Critical Theory. Simply being critical isn't enough; the critique must serve emancipatory ends.

2. The selected virtues should reflect the DIALECTICAL nature of Critical Theory - the interplay between individual and collective, theory and practice, critique and construction.

3. They should encompass both COGNITIVE capacities (understanding systems of oppression) and PRACTICAL orientations (acting for change).

4. The list should include virtues that support both RESISTANCE to domination and CONSTRUCTION of alternatives.

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of the most representative virtues:

1. CRITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS
- The fundamental capacity to recognize systems of domination
- Includes both analytical ability and emancipatory awareness
- Bridges individual insight and social understanding

2. EMANCIPATORY PRAXIS
- The integration of critical theory with transformative action
- Connects thinking with doing
- Embodies the unity of reflection and practice

3. DIALOGICAL SOLIDARITY
- The capacity for authentic communication across difference
- Combines recognition with collective action
- Supports both understanding and transformation

4. RADICAL HOPE
- The capacity to envision and work toward alternative futures
- Combines critique with constructive imagination
- Sustains transformative action

5. SYSTEMIC WISDOM
- Deep understanding of interconnected social systems
- Includes both analytical and practical knowledge
- Supports effective transformative action

6. RECOGNITION ETHICS
- The capacity to acknowledge and affirm human dignity
- Supports both individual and collective liberation
- Grounds transformative practice in human relationships

7. TRANSFORMATIVE COURAGE
- The willingness to challenge established power
- Combines critical awareness with practical action
- Supports both resistance and construction

8. DIALECTICAL THINKING
- The capacity to understand complex interrelationships
- Supports both analysis and transformation
- Bridges theory and practice

These eight virtues together capture the essential elements of Critical Theory Ethics while maintaining its distinctive character. Each virtue:
- Integrates theory and practice
- Connects individual and collective dimensions
- Supports both critical and constructive aspects
- Contributes directly to emancipatory goals
- Reflects the tradition's unique approach to social transformation
