I'll analyze Ma'at Philosophy and compile a list of virtues based on ancient Egyptian sources and scholarship.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
Ma'at as a philosophical and religious concept spans from the Old Kingdom (c. 2686-2181 BCE) through the Late Period (c. 664-332 BCE), with significant development during the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055-1650 BCE).

This compilation reveals Ma'at as a comprehensive system of virtues operating at multiple levels:
- Cosmic (universal order)
- Social (community harmony)
- Personal (individual character)
- Professional (vocational excellence)
- Religious (sacred obligations)

The system is notable for:
1. Integration of personal and cosmic order
2. Emphasis on practical application
3. Balance of individual and collective goods
4. Connection between moral and natural order
5. Unity of religious and secular virtues

This forms a foundation for creating detailed YAML nodes for specific virtues within the tradition.

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for any particular virtues from this list?
