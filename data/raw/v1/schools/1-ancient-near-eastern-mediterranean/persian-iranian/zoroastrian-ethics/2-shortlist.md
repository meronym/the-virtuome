Let me think through this systematically:

REASONING PROCESS:

1. FOUNDATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Zoroastrianism is fundamentally about moral choice and active participation in the cosmic struggle between good and evil
- The tradition emphasizes practical ethics over abstract philosophy
- The core teaching revolves around the threefold path of good thoughts, words, and deeds

2. STRUCTURAL IMPORTANCE:
- The Amesha Spentas (divine attributes) represent ideal qualities humans should cultivate
- The concept of Asha (truth/order) is absolutely central and influences all other virtues
- Personal responsibility and active choice are paramount

3. PRACTICAL EMPHASIS:
- Zoroastrian ethics focus on concrete actions and real-world applications
- Environmental stewardship and social responsibility are key elements
- The tradition values both individual development and communal harmony

4. SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Must include foundational concepts that shape the tradition's worldview
- Should represent both individual and social dimensions
- Must capture both contemplative and active aspects
- Should reflect the tradition's emphasis on progress and renewal
- Must include virtues that bridge spiritual and practical domains

5. HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT:
- Consider both early (Gathic) and later developments
- Include virtues that have shown sustained importance
- Consider those that have demonstrated practical value through history

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of core representative virtues:

CORE ZOROASTRIAN VIRTUES:

1. ASHA (Truth/Cosmic Order)
- The fundamental principle underlying all other virtues
- Represents both cosmic truth and personal righteousness
- The foundation of ethical decision-making

2. VOHU MANAH (Good Mind/Purpose)
- Active ethical intelligence
- Capacity for moral discernment
- Bridge between divine wisdom and human action

3. SPENTA ARMAITI (Holy Devotion/Wisdom)
- Practical wisdom in action
- Right relationship with creation
- Active care for the world

4. SRAOSHA (Spiritual Discipline/Obedience)
- Attentive listening to truth
- Disciplined practice
- Moral vigilance

5. HAITHYA (Truthfulness)
- Personal integrity
- Honest speech and action
- Alignment with Asha in daily life

6. DAENA (Conscience/Religious Insight)
- Inner moral compass
- Spiritual discernment
- Self-awareness

7. MITHRA (Covenant-Keeping)
- Faithfulness to commitments
- Social responsibility
- Ethical relationships

8. HUVARSTAY (Good Action)
- Active expression of ethics
- Practical righteousness
- Manifesting good in the world

9. FRASHOKERETI (Progressive Renewal)
- Continuous improvement
- Active participation in world renewal
- Ethical evolution

This selection:
- Covers both theoretical and practical dimensions
- Includes both personal and social virtues
- Represents both contemplative and active aspects
- Maintains connection to fundamental principles while including practical applications
- Shows progression from understanding (Asha) through discernment (Vohu Manah) to action (Huvarstay)
- Culminates in the progressive aspect (Frashokereti) that characterizes the tradition

Each of these virtues contains multiple layers of meaning and application, and together they provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and practicing Zoroastrian ethics.

Would you like me to develop full YAML nodes for any or all of these core virtues?
