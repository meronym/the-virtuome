Manichaean ethics fundamentally centers on the liberation of light from darkness, making this the ultimate ethical orientation.\n2. The tradition has both a cosmic and personal dimension that need to be represented.\n3. There's a hierarchical structure (Elect vs. Hearers) that influences virtue expression.\n4. The system is notably practical despite its cosmic scope.\n\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS:\n1. The most representative virtues should reflect:\n- The light/darkness dualism\n- The path to spiritual liberation\n- Both personal and cosmic dimensions\n- Practical ethical conduct\n- Knowledge/wisdom aspects\n\n2. We should prioritize virtues that:\n- Appear consistently across different Manichaean texts\n- Have clear practical applications\n- Connect personal conduct to cosmic purpose\n- Show the distinctive character of Manichean ethics\n\n3. Important distinctions:\n- Some virtues are means, others are ends\n- Some apply to all followers, others specifically to the Elect\n- Some are more fundamental, others derivative\n\nREASONING FOR SELECTION:\n1. Need core virtues reflecting the fundamental orientation toward light\n2. Must include both cognitive and practical dimensions\n3. Should represent both individual and communal aspects\n4. Must capture the unique Manichaean synthesis of various traditions\n5. Should reflect both immediate conduct and ultimate purpose\n\nPROPOSED SHORTLIST:\n\n1.

SALVIFIC DISCERNMENT (\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0bc7\u0b95\u0bae\u0bcd / vivekam)\n- Ability to distinguish light from darkness\n- Practical wisdom in daily choices\n- Guide for ethical decision-making\n\n3.
