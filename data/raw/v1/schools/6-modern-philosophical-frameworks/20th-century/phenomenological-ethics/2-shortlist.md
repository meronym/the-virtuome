Let me think through this systematically.

REASONING PROCESS:

1. CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF PHENOMENOLOGICAL ETHICS:
- Emphasis on direct experiential understanding
- Focus on conscious awareness and intentionality
- Importance of intersubjective relationships
- Integration of perception, embodiment, and action
- Commitment to authentic ethical engagement

2. KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Must reflect phenomenology's unique contribution to ethics
- Should capture both theoretical and practical aspects
- Need to represent both individual and intersubjective dimensions
- Should include both receptive and active virtues
- Must maintain connection to lived experience

3. ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES:
The shortlist should represent:
a) The methodological foundations of phenomenological ethics
b) The core experiential aspects of moral life
c) The intersubjective dimension of ethical experience
d) The practical manifestation of phenomenological insights

4. SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Centrality to phenomenological thought
- Distinctiveness from other ethical traditions
- Practical applicability
- Developmental potential
- Interconnectedness with other phenomenological virtues

PROPOSED SHORTLIST:

1. Phenomenological Openness (Offenheit)
- Foundation for all phenomenological inquiry
- Enables authentic ethical perception
- Combines receptivity with disciplined attention

2. Value-Recognition (Wertnehmung)
- Direct perception of moral values
- Core phenomenological contribution to ethics
- Bridges theory and practice

3. Authentic Presence (Eigentlichkeit)
- True to one's essential nature
- Resistant to inauthentic social pressures
- Foundation for genuine ethical action

4. Radical Responsibility (Verantwortung)
- Goes beyond conventional responsibility
- Encompasses response-ability to situations
- Links perception with action

5. Empathic Understanding (Einf√ºhlung)
- Essential for intersubjective ethics
- Combines cognitive and emotional insight
- Basis for moral recognition

6. Ethical Attention (Achtsamkeit)
- Sustained moral awareness
- Situational sensitivity
- Integration of perception and response

7. Embodied Wisdom (Leibliche Weisheit)
- Integration of thought and action
- Situated understanding
- Practical ethical knowledge

8. Dialogical Excellence (Dialogische Vortrefflichkeit)
- Authentic communication
- Intersubjective understanding
- Ethical discourse

9. Value-Responsive Action (Wertantwort)
- Integration of perception and action
- Practical manifestation of values
- Ethical effectiveness

This shortlist captures:
- The methodological foundations (1, 2)
- The experiential core (3, 4)
- The intersubjective dimension (5, 8)
- The practical manifestation (6, 7, 9)

Each virtue:
- Has clear phenomenological roots
- Represents a distinct aspect of ethical life
- Can be developed through practice
- Interrelates with other virtues
- Contributes to overall ethical development

These nine virtues together form a coherent system that represents the essential contribution of phenomenological ethics to virtue theory while maintaining practical relevance for ethical development.

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML+Markdown nodes for these nine core virtues?
