Let me analyze this carefully.

REASONING PROCESS:

1. CORE PRINCIPLES OF EXISTENTIALIST ETHICS:
- Emphasis on individual freedom and responsibility
- Recognition of life's fundamental absurdity/meaninglessness
- Need for personal meaning-creation
- Importance of authentic existence
- Rejection of predetermined values
- Universal implications of personal choices

2. KEY CONSIDERATIONS FOR SELECTION:
- Must reflect both individual and collective dimensions
- Should capture both active and reflective aspects
- Need to balance personal authenticity with social responsibility
- Must acknowledge both freedom and its burden
- Should include both courage-oriented and wisdom-oriented virtues

3. SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Centrality to existentialist thought
- Presence across multiple key thinkers
- Practical applicability
- Developmental potential
- Interconnectedness with other virtues

4. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Looking at existentialist virtues as a system, we can identify:
- Foundation virtues (enabling other virtues)
- Core operational virtues (daily practice)
- Advanced/synthetic virtues (combining others)
- Social/relational virtues (connecting to others)

Based on this analysis, I propose the following shortlist:

CORE EXISTENTIALIST VIRTUES:

1. AUTHENTICITY (authenticité)
   - Foundation virtue
   - Enables all other virtues
   - Central to existentialist ethics
   - Combines self-awareness with honest action

2. RADICAL RESPONSIBILITY (responsabilité radicale)
   - Core operational virtue
   - Links personal freedom with universal implications
   - Encompasses both individual and collective dimensions

3. LUCID COURAGE (courage lucide)
   - Synthetic virtue
   - Combines clear-sighted awareness with brave action
   - Essential for facing existence without illusion

4. CREATIVE ENGAGEMENT (engagement créatif)
   - Active virtue
   - Represents both personal meaning-creation and social involvement
   - Links individual authenticity with collective action

5. CONSCIOUS REBELLION (révolte consciente)
   - Advanced virtue
   - Principled resistance against absurdity
   - Combines awareness with active response

6. ETHICAL VIGILANCE (vigilance éthique)
   - Reflective virtue
   - Ongoing moral awareness and examination
   - Links freedom with responsibility

7. SOLIDARITY IN FREEDOM (solidarité dans la liberté)
   - Social virtue
   - Recognizes shared human condition while respecting individual freedom
   - Bridges personal authenticity and collective responsibility

8. AMBIGUITY WISDOM (sagesse de l'ambiguïté)
   - Advanced synthetic virtue
   - Capacity to live meaningfully while accepting uncertainty
   - Integrates multiple existential insights

This list captures:
- Both individual and collective dimensions
- Active and reflective aspects
- Freedom and responsibility
- Personal development and social engagement
- Practical and philosophical elements

Each virtue is:
- Distinctly existentialist
- Developable through practice
- Interconnected with others
- Applicable to contemporary challenges
- Grounded in key existentialist texts/thinkers

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these eight virtues?
