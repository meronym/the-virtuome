Let me analyze this carefully:

REASONING PROCESS:

1. CORE PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS
Environmental Ethics fundamentally seeks to:
- Redefine human-nature relationship
- Establish moral consideration for non-human entities
- Develop sustainable ways of living
- Foster responsibility toward future generations

2. KEY TRANSFORMATIONAL ASPECTS
The tradition aims to transform:
- Human perception of nature (from resource to community)
- Behavioral patterns (from exploitation to stewardship)
- Decision-making frameworks (from short-term to long-term)
- Ethical scope (from anthropocentric to eco/biocentric)

3. SELECTION CRITERIA
For the shortlist, I'm prioritizing virtues that:
- Represent fundamental shifts in human character needed for environmental ethics
- Bridge theoretical understanding with practical action
- Address both individual and collective dimensions
- Connect traditional virtue ethics with modern environmental challenges
- Support both preservation and restoration
- Enable sustainable human-nature relationships

4. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS
The virtues should form a coherent system that:
- Builds from basic awareness to advanced practice
- Covers both internal disposition and external action
- Addresses individual, social, and ecological dimensions
- Supports both immediate and long-term environmental responsibility

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist:

CORE ENVIRONMENTAL VIRTUES:

1. Ecological Wisdom (sophia oikologike)
- Foundation virtue combining understanding of natural systems with practical judgment
- Bridges scientific knowledge and ethical insight
- Enables informed environmental decision-making

2. Environmental Humility
- Recognition of human limitations and dependence on nature
- Counterbalance to technological hubris
- Foundation for learning from nature

3. Ecological Mindfulness
- Active awareness of environmental impact
- Present-moment attention to nature
- Basis for conscious environmental behavior

4. Biocentric Respect
- Recognition of inherent worth in all living things
- Extension of moral consideration beyond humans
- Foundation for environmental protection

5. Environmental Stewardship
- Active care for natural systems
- Responsible resource management
- Practical expression of ecological understanding

6. Ecological Resilience
- Capacity to adapt to environmental change
- Flexibility in face of uncertainty
- Strength in environmental challenges

7. Intergenerational Justice
- Consideration of future generations
- Long-term thinking
- Fair distribution of environmental benefits/burdens

8. Environmental Solidarity
- Collective action for environmental protection
- Community support for environmental initiatives
- Global environmental citizenship

9. Natural Reverence
- Deep appreciation for nature's intrinsic value
- Recognition of sacred in natural world
- Motivation for environmental protection

This selection:
- Covers cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects
- Includes both personal and collective virtues
- Addresses both preservation and restoration
- Supports both immediate action and long-term change
- Creates a progression from awareness to action
- Bridges individual practice with systemic change

These virtues work together as a system:
- Ecological Wisdom provides the cognitive foundation
- Environmental Humility enables learning
- Ecological Mindfulness ensures ongoing awareness
- Biocentric Respect establishes ethical framework
- Environmental Stewardship guides action
- Ecological Resilience enables adaptation
- Intergenerational Justice ensures long-term thinking
- Environmental Solidarity enables collective action
- Natural Reverence provides deep motivation
