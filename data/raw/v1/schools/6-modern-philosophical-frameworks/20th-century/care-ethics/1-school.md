I'll analyze Care Ethics to identify its key virtues, both explicit and implicit.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
Care Ethics emerged in the 1980s, primarily through the work of Carol Gilligan ("In a Different Voice," 1982) and Nel Noddings ("Caring," 1984), though it has roots in earlier feminist thought and philosophical discussions of moral sentiment.

The tradition continues to evolve, with new virtues being articulated as care ethics engages with contemporary issues like global ethics, environmental care, and institutional structures.

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML+Markdown nodes for any of these virtues?
