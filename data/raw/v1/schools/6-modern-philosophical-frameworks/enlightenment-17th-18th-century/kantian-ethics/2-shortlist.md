Let me think through this systematically:

REASONING PROCESS:

1. CORE PRINCIPLES OF KANTIAN ETHICS:
- Foundation in rational morality
- Universal moral law
- Duty and categorical imperative
- Human dignity and autonomy
- Kingdom of ends

2. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES:
- Focus on reason over emotion
- Emphasis on duty over consequences
- Universal principles over situational ethics
- Respect for rational nature
- Self-legislation of moral law

3. KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Must reflect Kant's emphasis on reason and duty
- Should capture both individual and universal aspects
- Need to include both internal dispositions and external actions
- Should reflect the systematic nature of Kant's thought
- Must connect to practical moral life

4. SELECTION CRITERIA:
a) Primary importance in Kant's writings
b) Central role in practical moral life
c) Connection to fundamental principles
d) Developmental potential
e) Universal applicability

5. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
- Need foundational virtues (e.g., good will)
- Need operational virtues (e.g., practical reason)
- Need relational virtues (e.g., respect)
- Need developmental virtues (e.g., moral wisdom)

PROPOSED SHORTLIST (with rationale):

1. Good Will (Guter Wille)
- The only unconditional good
- Foundation of all moral worth
- Core of Kantian virtue

2. Practical Reason (Praktische Vernunft)
- Essential for moral judgment
- Bridge between principle and action
- Tool for moral deliberation

3. Duty (Pflicht)
- Central motivating force
- Connection to moral law
- Guide for action

4. Autonomy (Autonomie)
- Self-legislation of moral law
- Basis of human dignity
- Essential for moral agency

5. Respect (Achtung)
- Recognition of moral law
- Basis for treating others
- Universal moral attitude

6. Moral Wisdom (Praktische Weisheit)
- Integration of knowledge and action
- Development of judgment
- Practical application of principles

7. Conscientiousness
- Attention to moral requirements
- Careful consideration of duty
- Vigilance in moral life

8. Integrity
- Unity of principle and action
- Moral wholeness
- Consistent self-legislation

9. Dignity (WÃ¼rde)
- Recognition of human worth
- Self-respect and respect for others
- Basis for moral status

This selection:
- Covers both theoretical and practical aspects
- Includes both individual and universal dimensions
- Represents development from foundation to application
- Maintains focus on reason while acknowledging character
- Preserves the systematic nature of Kant's thought

The virtues are arranged in a somewhat hierarchical/developmental order:
- Foundation (Good Will)
- Tools (Practical Reason)
- Motivation (Duty)
- Agency (Autonomy)
- Relation (Respect)
- Development (Moral Wisdom)
- Application (Conscientiousness)
- Integration (Integrity)
- Recognition (Dignity)

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML+Markdown nodes for these selected virtues?
