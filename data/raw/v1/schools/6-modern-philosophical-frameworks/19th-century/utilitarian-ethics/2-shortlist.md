Let me analyze this carefully to distill the essential virtues of Utilitarian Ethics.

ANALYTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Core Principles:
- The fundamental goal of maximizing overall welfare/happiness
- The emphasis on consequences over rules or intentions
- The requirement for impartial consideration
- The belief in rational calculation of outcomes
- The progressive vision of human improvement

2. Practical Requirements:
- The need to understand and predict outcomes
- The ability to consider multiple stakeholders
- The capacity for objective analysis
- The balance of immediate vs. long-term effects

3. Historical Context:
- Response to industrial revolution
- Reform movements
- Scientific advancement
- Democratic developments
- Educational expansion

4. Distinctive Features:
- Focus on measurable outcomes
- Emphasis on social reform
- Trust in human rationality
- Progressive optimism
- Scientific approach to ethics

REASONING FOR SELECTION:

1. We need virtues that capture both the theoretical framework and practical requirements of utilitarian ethics.

2. The selection should reflect both:
   - Individual qualities needed for utilitarian decision-making
   - Social qualities needed for utilitarian outcomes

3. The virtues should represent:
   - Cognitive aspects (rational calculation)
   - Emotional aspects (benevolence)
   - Practical aspects (efficiency)
   - Social aspects (impartiality)

4. We should include virtues that bridge:
   - Theory and practice
   - Individual and collective
   - Immediate and long-term
   - Rational and emotional

PROPOSED SHORTLIST:

1. Rational Benevolence
- The foundational utilitarian virtue
- Combines emotional care with rational calculation
- Reflects both heart and head of utilitarian thinking

2. Impartial Justice
- The ability to consider all interests equally
- Freedom from personal bias
- Universal perspective in moral calculation

3. Consequential Wisdom
- Understanding of cause-effect chains
- Foresight in action
- Long-term thinking

4. Social Intelligence
- Understanding collective dynamics
- Ability to predict social outcomes
- Awareness of systemic effects

5. Progressive Efficacy
- Practical ability to improve conditions
- Reform-mindedness
- Results-oriented action

6. Empirical Prudence
- Evidence-based thinking
- Scientific mindset
- Methodical analysis

7. Public Spirit
- Active concern for collective welfare
- Civic responsibility
- Community engagement

8. Higher Pleasure Cultivation
- Development of refined capabilities
- Intellectual and cultural sophistication
- Quality of happiness consideration

9. Systematic Understanding
- Grasp of interconnections
- Institutional awareness
- Complex system thinking

10. Welfare Promotion
- Active contribution to general happiness
- Positive impact creation
- Optimization of outcomes

This list captures the essential qualities needed for both understanding and implementing utilitarian ethics. It combines theoretical virtues (rational benevolence, impartial justice) with practical ones (progressive efficacy, systematic understanding), while maintaining the balance between individual development (higher pleasure cultivation) and social contribution (public spirit).

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these virtues, or would you prefer to refine this selection further?
