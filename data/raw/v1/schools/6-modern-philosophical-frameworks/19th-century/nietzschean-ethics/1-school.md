These virtues form a complex web of interrelated qualities that Nietzsche saw as characteristic of the "higher type" or "übermensch." They represent a radical revaluation of traditional virtue ethics, emphasizing:

- Active over passive qualities
- Creation over preservation
- Individual over collective values
- Life-affirmation over life-denial
- Strength over weakness
- Health over sickness
- Growth over stability
- Authenticity over conformity

This compilation represents the major virtues and qualities that can be extracted from Nietzsche's works, though it's important to note that he often presented these ideas in complex, nuanced ways that resist simple categorization.
