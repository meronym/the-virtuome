Noble Pride (Stolz)\n- Healthy self-valuation\n- Dignity without arrogance\n- Self-respect with generosity\n\n6. Creative Power (Schaffende Kraft)\n- Value creation\n- Cultural innovation\n- Personal artistry\n\n7. Amor Fati\n- Love of fate/necessity\n- Total life-affirmation\n- Joyful acceptance\n\n8. Psychological Strength (Seelenst\u00e4rke)\n- Inner sovereignty\n- Emotional resilience\n- Character depth\n\n9.
