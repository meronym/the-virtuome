I'll analyze Andean ethical traditions and compile a list of virtues. Note that many of these concepts come from Quechua and Aymara traditions, particularly as preserved through oral histories, archaeological evidence, colonial-era chronicles, and living practices.

CORE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND VIRTUES:

1. Fundamental Organizing Principles:
- Ayni (reciprocity/mutual aid)
- Yanantin (complementary duality)
- Masintin (cyclic reciprocity)
- Pachakuti (transformative renewal)

2. Social-Relational Virtues:
- Llank'ay (sacred work/productive activity)
- Yanapay (solidarity/helping others)
- Mink'a (collective work for common good)
- Rimanakuy (respectful dialogue/consensus building)

3. Environmental-Cosmic Virtues:
- Sumaq Kawsay (harmonious living)
- Allpa Mama Yupaychay (earth respect)
- Kawsay Pacha (life-force awareness)
- Uywana (careful stewardship)

4. Personal Character Virtues:
- Cheka Sunt'u (truthfulness/authenticity)
- Yachay (wisdom/knowledge seeking)
- K'uchi (joyful disposition)
- Kallpa (inner strength/resilience)

5. Community Leadership Virtues:
- Khuyaq Sunqu (compassionate heart)
- Allin Yachachiq (good teaching/guidance)
- Kamachiq (just authority)
- Qhapaq (noble wisdom)

6. Spiritual-Religious Virtues:
- Munay (pure love/will)
- Yuyay (mindful remembrance)
- Chanin (reverence/sacred respect)
- Wak'a Yupaychay (honoring sacred places)

7. Family/Kinship Virtues:
- Ayllu Khuyay (family/community love)
- Kuraq Yupaychay (elder respect)
- Wawa Khuyay (child nurturing)
- Yawar Masi (blood bonds honor)

8. Economic Virtues:
- Rakirinakuy (fair distribution)
- Wakcha Khuyaq (care for the poor)
- Qhapaq Kani (sufficiency without excess)
- Pirwa (abundance sharing)

9. Justice-Related Virtues:
- Cheqaq (justice/fairness)
- Allin Ruway (right action)
- Llank'ay Chanin (honest work)
- Kamachi (proper order)

10. Ecological Virtues:
- Pachamama Yupaychay (Earth Mother reverence)
- Tarpuy Yachay (wise cultivation)
- Kawsay Qhaway (life protection)
- Pacha Mama Uywana (Earth stewardship)

Important contextual notes:

1. Many of these concepts are deeply interconnected and cannot be fully understood in isolation

2. These virtues often exist within a cosmological framework that doesn't separate spiritual/material realms

3. Many concepts have regional variations and different expressions across Andean cultures

4. Contemporary interpretations often blend traditional understanding with modern applications

5. Some concepts are reconstructed from historical sources and living traditions

6. The translation/interpretation of these concepts into discrete "virtues" is somewhat artificial, as they exist within a holistic worldview

This list represents a synthesis from various sources including:
- Archaeological evidence
- Colonial chronicles
- Oral traditions
- Contemporary anthropological studies
- Living Indigenous practices
- Modern Indigenous scholarship

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect or move forward with creating detailed YAML nodes for specific virtues?
