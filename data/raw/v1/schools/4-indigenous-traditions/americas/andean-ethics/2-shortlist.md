Let me analyze this carefully to create a representative shortlist of Andean virtues.

REASONING PROCESS:

1. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Andean thought is fundamentally relational and cyclical
- Virtues exist within a web of reciprocal relationships
- The separation between cosmic/social/personal is less distinct than in Western frameworks

2. CORE CHARACTERISTICS:
- Emphasis on reciprocity and balance
- Integration of practical and spiritual dimensions
- Strong focus on community and environmental harmony
- Cyclical understanding of time and transformation

3. SELECTION CRITERIA:
a) Representative Power:
- Must capture the distinctive character of Andean ethics
- Should reflect both personal and collective dimensions
- Must include human-nature relationship elements

b) Foundational Impact:
- Should include virtues that generate or support other virtues
- Must capture key organizing principles of Andean life

c) Contemporary Relevance:
- Should bridge traditional and modern applications
- Must remain meaningful in current contexts

4. ORGANIZATIONAL LOGIC:
I propose organizing the shortlist around three interconnected spheres:
- Fundamental organizing principles
- Relational virtues
- Practical manifestations
