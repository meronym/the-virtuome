Let me think through this systematically:

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:
1. First, I need to consider what makes Amazonian ethics distinctive from other Indigenous traditions while acknowledging common threads.
2. Must balance between universal human values and culturally-specific expressions.
3. Need to focus on virtues that are particularly emphasized or uniquely expressed in Amazonian contexts.
4. Should consider both individual character development and communal/ecological relationships.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS:

1. WORLDVIEW FOUNDATION:
- Amazonian peoples generally view humans as part of an interconnected web of life
- Strong emphasis on reciprocal relationships with nature
- No sharp distinction between physical and spiritual realms
- Time conceived more cyclically than linearly

2. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES:
- Particularly strong emphasis on forest relationship
- Complex understanding of ecological interdependence
- Sophisticated plant knowledge and relationship systems
- Highly developed practices of dream wisdom
- Strong focus on community consensus rather than hierarchical authority

3. VIRTUE DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT:
- Virtues often developed through direct experience and mentorship
- Strong emphasis on practical wisdom over abstract principles
- Virtues typically understood through stories and lived experience
- Development often tied to specific ecological relationships

4. SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Must be foundational to the tradition
- Should be widely shared across different Amazonian cultures
- Must have clear practical applications
- Should reflect both personal and communal dimensions
- Must capture unique Amazonian perspectives

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of core Amazonian virtues:

1. "Ecological Reciprocity" (various tribal terms)
- The virtue of maintaining balanced, respectful relationships with nature
- Foundation for sustainable living and spiritual harmony

2. "Forest Wisdom" (various tribal terms)
- Deep understanding of forest relationships and cycles
- Combines practical knowledge with spiritual insight

3. "Communal Harmony"
- Ability to maintain balanced relationships within community
- Includes conflict resolution and resource sharing

4. "Ancestral-Future Responsibility"
- Honoring ancestral knowledge while preserving resources for future generations
- Links temporal dimensions of community

5. "Spirit-World Integration"
- Capacity to maintain proper relationships with spiritual dimensions
- Includes dream wisdom and ceremonial responsibility

6. "Healing Integration"
- Understanding of physical-spiritual healing relationships
- Includes plant knowledge and healing ethics

7. "Knowledge Stewardship"
- Responsibility for preserving and transmitting traditional knowledge
- Includes both practical and spiritual dimensions

8. "Ecological Mindfulness"
- Constant awareness of environmental relationships and impacts
- Practical expression of ecological understanding

9. "Distributive Justice"
- Fair sharing of resources and responsibilities
- Maintains community balance and harmony

These virtues are interconnected and mutually reinforcing, forming a coherent ethical framework that:
- Emphasizes relationship over individual achievement
- Integrates practical and spiritual dimensions
- Maintains both community and ecological balance
- Preserves knowledge across generations
- Guides sustainable living practices

Would you like me to:
1. Elaborate on any of these virtues?
2. Create YAML nodes for them?
3. Explore their contemporary applications?
4. Examine their historical development?
