Let me think through this carefully:

REASONING PROCESS:

1. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Māori ethics are holistic and interconnected
- Many concepts overlap or contain aspects of others
- Some virtues are more foundational, while others are derivative

2. SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Foundational importance to the tradition
- Distinctiveness of the concept
- Breadth of application
- Frequency in traditional teachings
- Contemporary relevance
- Role in character development

3. KEY OBSERVATIONS:
- Mana and tapu are fundamental organizing principles
- Relationships (with people, nature, ancestors) are central
- Individual virtues are always understood in collective context
- Environmental stewardship is inseparable from personal ethics
- Spiritual and practical dimensions are integrated

4. SYNTHESIS APPROACH:
- Include core metaphysical concepts that ground the ethics
- Represent both individual and collective dimensions
- Cover spiritual, social, and practical domains
- Ensure the selected virtues work together as a system
- Focus on transformative rather than merely descriptive concepts

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of core Māori virtues:

1. MANA
- Foundational concept of power, prestige, and honor
- Both personal and collective
- Guides development of character and leadership

2. WHANAUNGATANGA
- Relationship-building and maintenance
- Foundation of social ethics
- Extends beyond human relationships to nature and ancestors

3. KAITIAKITANGA
- Guardianship/stewardship
- Environmental and cultural responsibility
- Active expression of relationship with nature

4. MANAAKITANGA
- Hospitality and care for others
- Practical expression of aroha (love)
- Central to social harmony

5. TAPU
- Sacred restrictions and spiritual wisdom
- Guides behavior and respect
- Maintains social and spiritual order

6. AROHA
- Love, compassion, empathy
- Motivating force for ethical behavior
- Connects individual to collective wellbeing

7. TIKA
- Righteousness and correct action
- Practical wisdom in applying principles
- Guide for decision-making

8. PONO
- Truth, integrity, authenticity
- Personal and interpersonal honesty
- Foundation for trust

These eight virtues form a coherent system where:
- Mana and tapu provide the metaphysical foundation
- Whanaungatanga and aroha establish relational orientation
- Kaitiakitanga and manaakitanga guide practical action
- Tika and pono ensure proper implementation

Each virtue:
- Has both personal and collective dimensions
- Connects to spiritual and practical realms
- Contributes to character development
- Remains relevant in contemporary contexts
- Works in harmony with the others

This selection provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and developing virtue while maintaining the distinctive characteristics of Māori ethical thought.

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these core virtues?
