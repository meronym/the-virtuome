I'll help analyze Māori ethical traditions and compile key virtues. Here's a systematic breakdown:

CORE CONCEPTS & FOUNDATIONS:
- Based on oral traditions, whakapapa (genealogy), tikanga (customs), and kawa (protocols)
- Embedded in pūrākau (stories), whakataukī (proverbs), karakia (prayers), and waiata (songs)
- Strongly connected to land (whenua), tribe (iwi), and ancestry (tīpuna)

KEY VIRTUES AND ETHICAL PRINCIPLES:

1. FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS:
- Mana (personal/collective power, honor, prestige)
- Tapu (sacredness, spiritual restriction)
- Mauri (life force, vital essence)
- Wairua (spirituality, soul)

2. RELATIONAL VIRTUES:
- Whanaungatanga (relationship building, family connections)
- Kotahitanga (unity, collective harmony)
- Aroha (love, compassion, empathy)
- Manaakitanga (hospitality, generosity, care)

3. LEADERSHIP VIRTUES:

4. COMMUNAL VIRTUES:

6. ENVIRONMENTAL VIRTUES:

7. BEHAVIORAL VIRTUES:

9. CEREMONIAL VIRTUES:

- Tapu (sacred observance)

10. COLLECTIVE WELLBEING:
- Oranga (wellness)
- Hauora (health and vitality)
- Mauri ora (life principle)
- Waiora (total wellbeing)

CONTEXTUAL ELEMENTS:
- These virtues are interconnected and cannot be fully separated
- Often expressed through action rather than abstract concepts
- Deeply embedded in daily practices and ceremonies
- Transmitted through oral traditions and lived experience
- Contemporary interpretations blend traditional and modern contexts

MODERN APPLICATIONS:
- Educational framework development
- Environmental conservation
- Healthcare approaches
- Business ethics
- Legal and justice systems
- Cultural revitalization efforts
- Community development

This list represents key virtues identifiable in Māori ethical traditions, though it's important to note that these concepts are deeply interconnected and often overlap in practice. Their meanings can vary between different iwi (tribes) and contexts, and many have deeper layers of meaning that emerge through practice and oral transmission.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect or move forward with creating detailed YAML nodes for specific virtues?
