Let me think through this systematically.

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:
To identify the most representative virtues, I'm considering several key factors:

1. FOUNDATIONAL CRITERIA:
- How central is the virtue to African worldview
- How frequently it appears across different African cultures
- Its role in maintaining social and cosmic harmony
- Its relationship to other virtues (is it foundational?)

2. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- The African worldview is fundamentally relational
- There's no sharp distinction between sacred and secular
- Community takes precedence over individuality
- Strong emphasis on practical wisdom over abstract principles

3. ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES:
- The virtues should represent both personal and communal dimensions
- They should reflect both practical and spiritual aspects
- They should capture both being and doing
- They should represent both preservation and development

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS:
- Many African virtues are interconnected and mutually reinforcing
- Some virtues are more foundational, giving rise to others
- Certain virtues serve as bridges between different domains (spiritual/material, individual/communal)
- Some virtues are more explicitly articulated, while others are deeply implicit in practices

REASONING FOR SELECTION:
I propose focusing on virtues that:
1. Form the philosophical foundation of African ethics
2. Have broad recognition across different African cultures
3. Connect individual character with communal wellbeing
4. Integrate spiritual and practical dimensions
5. Enable other virtuous practices and behaviors

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of most representative virtues:

1. Ubuntu (Human Interdependence)
- The foundational virtue expressing the essence of African humanism
- Provides the philosophical basis for other virtues
- Integrates individual and communal dimensions

2. Ukama (Relationality)
- Extends Ubuntu to include relationships with nature and spirits
- Bridges material and spiritual realms
- Essential for environmental and social ethics

3. Maat (Harmony/Balance)
- Represents cosmic and social order
- Guides both personal and communal conduct
- Integrates moral and natural law

4. Iwa-pele (Good Character)
- Encompasses personal moral development
- Links individual virtue to communal wellbeing
- Provides practical guidance for behavior

5. Ujima (Collective Responsibility)
- Translates philosophical principles into practical action
- Emphasizes shared burden and collective achievement
- Bridges individual duty and community needs

6. Busara (Wisdom)
- Integrates knowledge, experience, and judgment
- Guides application of other virtues
- Links ancestral wisdom with present needs

7. Harambee (Pulling Together)
- Expresses practical solidarity
- Embodies cooperative action
- Demonstrates ubuntu in practice

8. Itutu (Inner Coolness)
- Represents emotional and spiritual maturity
- Guides conflict resolution and peace-making
- Balances internal state with external action

9. Uadilifu (Justice/Fairness)
- Ensures social harmony
- Guides leadership and conflict resolution
- Balances individual rights with communal needs

This selection:
- Covers both theoretical and practical dimensions
- Includes both personal and communal virtues
- Represents both being and doing
- Integrates spiritual and material concerns
- Provides foundation for other virtues
- Captures essential aspects of African ethical thought
