Let me think through this systematically:

ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK:

1. KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
- West African ethical systems are fundamentally relational and communal
- They emphasize the development of character through social relationships
- They integrate personal, social, and spiritual dimensions
- They focus on practical wisdom and lived expression rather than abstract principles
- They view individual development as inseparable from community well-being

2. SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Foundational nature (how central is it to the ethical system?)
- Frequency of appearance across different West African cultures
- Interconnectedness (how many other virtues it supports or enables)
- Practical impact on individual and community development
- Cultural distinctiveness and depth of meaning

3. STRUCTURAL PATTERNS:
- Most West African ethical systems show a layered structure:
  * Core relational principles
  * Character development virtues
  * Social harmony maintainers
  * Spiritual-practical integrators

4. INTEGRATIVE THEMES:
- The interdependence of individual and community
- The unity of spiritual and practical life
- The importance of wisdom in maintaining harmony
- The role of character in social stability
- The cultivation of dignity through responsibility

REASONING FOR SELECTION:

1. We need virtues that represent both individual character development AND communal harmony, as these are inseparable in West African thought.

2. The selection should include virtues that:
- Guide personal development
- Structure social relationships
- Maintain community harmony
- Connect spiritual and practical life
- Enable cultural transmission

3. Priority should be given to virtues that:
- Have deep linguistic/cultural specificity
- Demonstrate unique African philosophical contributions
- Show practical applicability
- Reflect holistic wisdom traditions
- Enable other virtuous behaviors

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of core representative virtues:

1. OMOLUABI (Yoruba: ọmọlúàbí) - Moral personhood/dignity
- Represents the ideal of complete character development
- Integrates personal virtue with social responsibility
- Functions as a master virtue that encompasses others

2. SUURU (Yoruba: sùúrù) - Deep patience/inner calm
- More than simple patience; includes emotional wisdom
- Essential for both personal development and social harmony
- Enables other virtues through self-regulation

3. WA (Akan) - Social harmony/communal peace
- Represents the ideal of harmonious community living
- Integrates individual and collective well-being
- Guides social interaction and conflict resolution

4. JOM (Wolof) - Dignified behavior/honor
- Combines personal dignity with social responsibility
- Guides behavior in both private and public spheres
- Essential for leadership and elder status

5. IWA PELE (Yoruba: ìwà pẹ̀lẹ́) - Gentle/refined character
- Represents the cultivation of ethical refinement
- Combines humility with dignity
- Essential for social grace and leadership

6. ANJOLA (Yoruba: àánú) - Deep empathy/compassion
- Goes beyond simple kindness to deep understanding
- Essential for community building and healing
- Connects individual virtue with social responsibility

7. TERANGA (Wolof) - Radical hospitality
- More than simple hospitality; a way of being
- Essential for community building and social bonds
- Represents African communal philosophy in action

8. OGBON (Yoruba: ọgbọ́n) - Wisdom in action
- Practical wisdom gained through experience
- Combines knowledge with ethical judgment
- Essential for leadership and elder status

These virtues together form a coherent system that:
- Covers personal development and social harmony
- Integrates practical and spiritual dimensions
- Represents distinctly African philosophical contributions
- Provides practical guidance for character development
- Maintains cultural continuity while allowing adaptation

Would you like me to:
1. Elaborate on any of these specific virtues?
2. Explain their interrelationships?
3. Proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for them?
4. Analyze their historical development?
