Let me think through this systematically.

ANALYTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:

1. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF MODERN CHRISTIAN ETHICS:
- Bridges traditional Christian virtues with contemporary challenges
- Emphasizes both personal and social transformation
- Integrates individual spirituality with collective responsibility
- Maintains dialogue between faith tradition and modern world
- Addresses systemic/structural aspects of moral life

2. KEY DEVELOPMENTS FROM TRADITIONAL CHRISTIAN ETHICS:
- Shift from purely individual to social/structural understanding
- Greater emphasis on active engagement vs. passive piety
- Integration of social sciences and contemporary philosophy
- Focus on concrete application vs. abstract principles
- Recognition of plurality and complexity in moral life

3. SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Must reflect both personal and social dimensions
- Should bridge contemplative and active aspects
- Need to address contemporary challenges
- Must maintain connection to Christian tradition
- Should be applicable across denominational lines

4. ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS:
- Transformative potential (both personal and social)
- Practical applicability
- Theological grounding
- Contemporary relevance
- Universal accessibility while maintaining Christian distinctiveness

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of most representative virtues:

1. PROPHETIC WITNESS
- Combines traditional testimony with social critique
- Integrates personal faith with public responsibility
- Addresses both individual and structural sin
- Links contemplation with action

2. TRANSFORMATIVE SOLIDARITY
- Goes beyond mere compassion to active engagement
- Addresses systemic injustice while maintaining personal relationship
- Combines love with justice
- Reflects preferential option for the poor

3. DIALOGICAL WISDOM
- Integrates faith and reason
- Enables engagement with plural perspectives
- Maintains truth while acknowledging complexity
- Bridges tradition and contemporary insight

4. ECOLOGICAL STEWARDSHIP
- Updates traditional creation care for contemporary crisis
- Links personal lifestyle with systemic change
- Integrates scientific and spiritual perspectives
- Addresses intergenerational responsibility

5. INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY
- Transforms traditional communion for plural context
- Balances identity and openness
- Practices radical hospitality
- Maintains unity in diversity

6. PROPHETIC HOPE
- Combines realistic assessment with transformative vision
- Maintains faith in possibility of change
- Energizes long-term commitment
- Bridges present action and future vision

7. CRITICAL FAITHFULNESS
- Maintains tradition while enabling reform
- Combines loyalty with discernment
- Enables authentic development
- Integrates faith and critical thinking

These seven virtues together capture:
- Personal and social dimensions
- Contemplative and active aspects
- Traditional grounding and contemporary relevance
- Individual and structural transformation
- Theory and practice
- Faith and engagement with world

Each virtue is:
- Distinctively Christian yet universally relevant
- Theoretically grounded yet practically applicable
- Personally transformative yet socially engaged
- Traditionally rooted yet contemporarily expressed

This selection aims to capture the essence of modern Christian ethical development while maintaining clear connection to the broader Christian tradition and enabling engagement with contemporary challenges.
