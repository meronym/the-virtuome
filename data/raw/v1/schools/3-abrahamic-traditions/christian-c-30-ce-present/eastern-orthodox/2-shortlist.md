Let me think through this carefully...

REASONING PROCESS:

1. THEOLOGICAL FOUNDATION
Eastern Orthodox Christianity is distinctively characterized by:
- Focus on theosis (deification/divine participation)
- Holistic integration of body, mind, and spirit
- Emphasis on transformative practice over theoretical knowledge
- Strong connection between personal and communal spiritual life

2. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES
What makes Eastern Orthodox virtue ethics unique:
- Less juridical/legalistic than Western Christianity
- Stronger emphasis on mystical/experiential aspects
- Integration of ascetic and communal practices
- Focus on gradual transformation through divine energies

3. SELECTION CRITERIA
To create a representative shortlist, virtues should:
- Reflect both personal and communal aspects
- Include both practical and mystical dimensions
- Represent different levels of spiritual development
- Capture the distinctive Orthodox emphasis on transformation
- Be historically consistent across Orthodox tradition
- Have clear practical applications

4. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS
The virtues should form a coherent system that:
- Shows clear interconnections
- Supports progressive development
- Balances different aspects of spiritual life
- Reflects both divine and human aspects

Based on this analysis, here's the proposed shortlist:
