- Essential for both individual character and governance

4. Ma'rifah (معرفة) - Deep Knowledge
- Goes beyond mere information to true understanding
- Combines rational knowledge with spiritual insight
- Progressive development from empirical to divine knowledge

5. Wasatiyyah (وسطية) - Golden Mean

- Adaptation of Aristotelian mean with Islamic principles
- Practical guide for character development

6. Baseera (بصيرة) - Insight

8. Tafakkur (تفكر) - Contemplation

- Includes individual and social aspects
- Represents the integration of rational and spiritual elements

Each virtue is interconnected with the others, forming a coherent system of human development rather than isolated qualities. This reflects the falsafa tradition's emphasis on the unity and interconnectedness of virtues.

The list provides a pathway from basic rational development through practical wisdom to the highest forms of philosophical and spiritual excellence, while maintaining the practical focus on character development and social harmony that characterizes Islamic philosophy.
