Let me think through this systematically.

REASONING PROCESS:

1. DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF KOREAN BUDDHISM:
- Emphasis on harmonization and integration
- Practical orientation over theoretical speculation
- Balance between sudden enlightenment and gradual cultivation
- Strong community/social dimension
- Deep connection with nature and environment

2. HISTORICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Wonhyo's emphasis on harmonization and One Mind (일심)
- Chinul's integration of meditation and wisdom
- The sustained importance of both meditation (선) and doctrinal study (교)
- Development during periods of both state support and suppression
- Modern emphasis on engaged Buddhism

3. SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Must reflect core Buddhist values while capturing Korean distinctiveness
- Should represent both contemplative and active aspects
- Must include both individual cultivation and social dimensions
- Should reflect the tradition's emphasis on integration and harmony
- Must be practically applicable while maintaining spiritual depth

4. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Need foundational virtues that support other virtues
- Need both internal cultivation and external expression
- Need both individual and collective dimensions
- Need both active and receptive qualities
- Should reflect the tradition's holistic approach

Based on this analysis, I propose the following shortlist of core representative virtues:

1. 일심 (Ilsim) - One Mind/Unity
- Foundation of Korean Buddhist thought
- Integrates wisdom and practice
- Bridges sudden enlightenment and gradual cultivation

2. 통찰 (Tongchal) - Penetrating Insight
- Combines wisdom with practical understanding
- Reflects Korean emphasis on direct experience
- Integrates study and meditation

3. 화합 (Hwahap) - Harmonious Integration
- Key to Korean Buddhist syncretism
- Reflects social and communal emphasis
- Bridges individual and collective practice

4. 정진 (Jeongjin) - Sustained Effort
- Emphasizes gradual cultivation
- Reflects practical orientation
- Balances sudden enlightenment teaching

5. 자비 (Jabi) - Compassionate Wisdom
- Korean interpretation of karuna
- Practical expression of insight
- Social engagement foundation

6. 상생 (Sangsaeng) - Mutual Flourishing
- Distinctly Korean development
- Environmental/social awareness
- Community orientation

7. 무애 (Muae) - Non-obstruction
- Freedom in action
- Natural spontaneity
- Integration of wisdom and activity

8. 회통 (Hoetong) - Reconciliation/Synthesis
- Characteristic Korean approach
- Integration of different views
- Practical problem-solving

These eight virtues form an interconnected system that:
- Begins with fundamental unity (일심)
- Develops through insight (통찰)
- Expresses through harmony (화합)
- Is sustained by effort (정진)
- Manifests as compassion (자비)
- Creates mutual benefit (상생)
- Acts with freedom (무애)
- Integrates all aspects (회통)

This selection captures both:
- The philosophical depth of Korean Buddhism
- Its practical orientation
- Its social dimension
- Its environmental awareness
- Its emphasis on integration
- Its balance of sudden and gradual approaches

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these virtues?
