Let me think about this systematically:

REASONING PROCESS:

1. CORE PRINCIPLES TO CONSIDER:
- The ultimate goal of yoga is liberation/self-realization
- The path is both practical and transformative
- There's a progression from external to internal practices
- The tradition emphasizes both personal development and universal consciousness
- The approach is holistic, integrating body, mind, and spirit

2. SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Foundational importance in the tradition
- Developmental sequence/progression
- Practical applicability
- Transformative potential
- Universal relevance
- Cross-textual presence
- Historical continuity
- Contemporary relevance

3. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Should include both preparatory and advanced virtues
- Need to represent both active and contemplative aspects
- Must cover both individual development and universal awareness
- Should include both practical and transcendental elements

4. ORGANIZATIONAL LOGIC:
I think the list should reflect the yogic journey from:
- External discipline → Internal refinement
- Physical → Mental → Spiritual
- Individual → Universal
- Action → Awareness → Integration

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of most representative virtues:

CORE REPRESENTATIVE VIRTUES:

1. TAPAS (तपस्) - Disciplined Effort
- Foundation of all yogic practice
- Represents the transformative fire of practice
- Bridges physical and spiritual aspects
- Essential for all stages of development

2. VIVEKA (विवेक) - Discriminative Wisdom
- Core faculty for spiritual progress
- Distinguishes real from unreal
- Guides all practice decisions
- Essential for both practice and realization

3. SVADHYAYA (स्वाध्याय) - Self-Study
- Links external learning with internal awareness
- Combines intellectual and experiential knowledge
- Progressive deepening of self-understanding
- Bridge between practice and wisdom

4. SANTOSHA (सन्तोष) - Contentment
- Cultivates positive mental state
- Balances effort with acceptance
- Supports sustainable practice
- Creates foundation for deeper work

5. AHIMSA (अहिंसा) - Non-violence
- Universal ethical foundation
- Applies to body, speech, and mind
- Extends from personal to universal
- Basis for all other virtues

6. VAIRAGYA (वैराग्य) - Detachment
- Essential for spiritual progress
- Balances engagement with non-attachment
- Supports clear perception
- Enables higher states of consciousness

7. SHRADDHA (श्रद्धा) - Faith/Trust
- Sustains long-term practice
- Balances effort and surrender
- Bridges known and unknown
- Supports transformation

8. SAMYAMA (संयम) - Integration
- Represents mastery of attention
- Unifies different aspects of practice
- Bridges individual and universal
- Goal and means of practice

9. KARUNA (करुणा) - Compassion
- Expands individual awareness to universal
- Balances wisdom with heart
- Essential for complete development
- Links personal practice with benefit for all

This list represents:
- The progression of practice
- Both individual and universal aspects
- Practical and transcendent qualities
- Active and contemplative elements
- Foundation and fruition of practice

These virtues work together as an integrated system:
- Some are foundational (Ahimsa, Tapas)
- Some are developmental (Svadhyaya, Viveka)
- Some are fruitive (Samyama, Karuna)
- Some span the entire journey (Shraddha, Vairagya)

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML+Markdown nodes for these core virtues?
