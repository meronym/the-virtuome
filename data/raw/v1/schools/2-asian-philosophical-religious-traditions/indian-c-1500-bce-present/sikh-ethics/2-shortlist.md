Let me think through this systematically.

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:
To identify the most representative virtues for Sikh ethics, I'll consider:

1. FOUNDATIONAL CRITERIA:
- Frequency and emphasis in primary texts
- Centrality to Sikh spiritual practice
- Historical significance in tradition development
- Practical impact on daily Sikh life
- Distinctive characteristics vs other Indian traditions

2. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:
The selected virtues should:
- Reflect both spiritual and temporal aspects (Miri-Piri principle)
- Cover individual and communal dimensions
- Represent both contemplative and active elements
- Embody the revolutionary social vision of Sikhism
- Connect to contemporary relevance

3. UNIQUE ASPECTS OF SIKH VIRTUE FRAMEWORK:
- Integration of devotional and social action
- Emphasis on lived practice over theoretical understanding
- Balance of individual spiritual development and communal responsibility
- Rejection of asceticism in favor of engaged householder life
- Revolutionary egalitarianism and social justice orientation

4. HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT:
- Guru Nanak's founding vision
- Evolution through subsequent Gurus
- Institutionalization under Khalsa
- Modern interpretations and applications

REASONING FOR SELECTION:
The shortlist should capture:
- Core spiritual transformation principles
- Active social engagement requirements
- Personal character development elements
- Communal responsibility aspects
- Distinctive Sikh innovations in virtue ethics

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of most representative Sikh virtues:

1. Seva (ਸੇਵਾ) - Selfless Service
- Represents active expression of spiritual realization
- Integrates individual development with community welfare
- Fundamental to Sikh institutional practices

2. Sat (ਸਤਿ) - Truth/Authenticity
- Both metaphysical truth and ethical truthfulness
- Foundation for personal integrity
- Links individual conduct with ultimate reality

3. Nimrata (ਨਿਮਰਤਾ) - Humility
- Counterbalance to sovereign dignity
- Essential for spiritual progress
- Distinctive Sikh interpretation of ego transcendence

4. Sarbat da Bhala (ਸਰਬੱਤ ਦਾ ਭਲਾ) - Universal Welfare
- Expresses unique Sikh universalism
- Combines spiritual wisdom with social action
- Relevant to contemporary global challenges

5. Santoḵẖ (ਸੰਤੋਖ) - Contentment
- Active acceptance rather than passive resignation
- Balance of spiritual peace and temporal engagement
- Key to personal transformation

6. Nirbhau (ਨਿਰਭਉ) - Fearlessness
- Spiritual courage and moral conviction
- Essential for standing against injustice
- Distinctive Sikh contribution to virtue ethics

7. Gian (ਗਿਆਨ) - Divine Knowledge
- Experiential wisdom rather than mere intellectual knowledge
- Integration of spiritual insight with practical action
- Foundation for ethical discernment

8. Kirat (ਕਿਰਤ) - Honest Labor/Living
- Distinctive householder ethics
- Integration of spiritual and temporal duties
- Economic ethics and social responsibility

9. Chardi Kala (ਚੜ੍ਹਦੀ ਕਲਾ) - Eternal Optimism
- Resilience and spiritual buoyancy
- Positive engagement with life challenges
- Distinctive Sikh psychological framework

This selection provides:
- Coverage of key dimensions of Sikh ethics
- Balance of contemplative and active elements
- Distinctive Sikh contributions to virtue theory
- Practical guidance for contemporary life
- Framework for personal and social transformation

Each virtue interlinks with others, forming a coherent system of ethical development while remaining practically applicable. They represent both timeless principles and dynamic responses to contemporary challenges.
