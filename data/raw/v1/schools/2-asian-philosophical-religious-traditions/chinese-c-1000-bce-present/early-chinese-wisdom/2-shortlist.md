Let me think through this systematically:

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:
1. First, I need to consider what makes Early Chinese Wisdom distinct from later developments (like systematic Confucianism or Daoism)
2. Focus on virtues that emerged from practical experience rather than philosophical systematization
3. Consider the primary concerns and contexts of the period:
   - Agricultural society
   - Early state formation
   - Family/clan-based social structure
   - Ancestral worship
   - Heaven-Earth-Human relationships

KEY CONSIDERATIONS:

1. The tradition shows a strong integration of:
- Cosmic order (Heaven)
- Social order (Human relations)
- Natural order (Earth/Agriculture)

2. Virtues typically have multiple dimensions:
- Personal cultivation aspect
- Social application aspect
- Cosmic/natural resonance aspect

3. The most fundamental virtues tend to:
- Appear across multiple source texts
- Connect multiple spheres of life
- Show clear practical applications
- Influence later developments
- Maintain relevance through time

4. Priority should be given to virtues that:
- Are explicitly mentioned in early texts
- Show clear evidence of practical implementation
- Demonstrate developmental continuity
- Connect different aspects of life

REASONING FOR SELECTION:

I believe the most representative virtues should:
1. Cover the key dimensions of early Chinese life
2. Show the integration of cosmic-social-natural orders
3. Demonstrate practical wisdom rather than abstract philosophy
4. Reflect the foundational concerns of the period
5. Show clear influence on later developments

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of the most representative virtues:

1. Dé 德 (Moral Power/Virtue)
- The fundamental cosmic-moral force
- Links personal cultivation with natural/social influence
- Foundation for all other virtues

2. Jìng 敬 (Reverence)
- Proper attitude toward Heaven, ancestors, and authority
- Links ritual practice with inner cultivation
- Essential for both religious and social life

3. Zhōng 忠 (Loyalty/Faithfulness)
- Core social-relational virtue
- Links personal integrity with social responsibility
- Foundation for trust and order

4. Zhì 智 (Practical Wisdom)
- Ability to recognize and act on patterns
- Links natural observation with human action
- Essential for governance and agriculture

5. Hé 和 (Harmony)
- Integration of differences into functional whole
- Links cosmic, social, and natural orders
- Balance of action and restraint

6. Xìn 信 (Trustworthiness)
- Reliability in word and deed
- Links personal character with social function
- Essential for all relationships

7. Xiào 孝 (Filial Piety)
- Foundation of family and social order
- Links living with ancestors
- Pattern for all hierarchical relationships

8. Qín 勤 (Diligence)
- Practical application of effort
- Links human action with natural timing
- Essential for agricultural success

These eight virtues together:
- Cover personal, social, and cosmic dimensions
- Include both active and receptive qualities
- Represent practical wisdom from lived experience
- Show clear influence on later developments
- Maintain relevance through historical changes

Each virtue connects to others while maintaining its distinct emphasis, creating a web of meaning that characterizes Early Chinese Wisdom's approach to human development and social harmony.

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML+Markdown nodes for these virtues?
