Let me analyze this carefully to distill the most representative virtues of Mohism:

ANALYTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:

1. CORE PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION
Mohism was fundamentally a practical, utilitarian philosophy focused on:
- Maximizing societal benefit
- Promoting universal ethical standards
- Emphasizing measurable results
- Advocating rational approaches to problems

2. DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS
What made Mohism unique in Chinese thought was:
- Opposition to Confucian familial preference
- Emphasis on universal rather than graduated love
- Focus on practical benefit over ritual
- Merit-based rather than hereditary values
- Scientific/logical approach to ethics

3. HIERARCHY OF VIRTUES
In Mohist thought, virtues appear to be valued based on:
- Their contribution to collective welfare
- Their practical utility
- Their universal applicability
- Their measurable effects

4. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION
Mohists were concerned with:
- How virtues could be practically applied
- Their demonstrable benefits
- Their teachability and reproducibility
- Their social scalability

Based on these considerations, I would propose the following shortlist of core Mohist virtues, organized in conceptual clusters:

FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES:
1. Universal Love (兼愛, jiān'ài)
- The cornerstone of Mohist ethics
- Represents their most distinctive contribution
- Opposes Confucian graduated love
- Foundation for other virtues

2. Practical Wisdom (知, zhī)
- Rational understanding
- Evidence-based thinking
- Technical competence
- Problem-solving ability

SOCIAL IMPLEMENTATION:
3. Meritocratic Virtue (尚賢, shàngxián)
- Recognition of ability
- Fair evaluation
- Promotion by merit
- Leadership quality

4. Impartial Care (公義, gōngyì)
- Fair treatment
- Equal consideration
- Universal application
- Ethical consistency

PRACTICAL VIRTUES:
5. Productive Diligence (勤勞, qínláo)
- Industrious effort
- Practical contribution
- Skilled work
- Beneficial action

6. Frugal Efficiency (節用, jiéyòng)
- Resource optimization
- Practical thrift
- Sustainable use
- Economic wisdom

SOCIAL HARMONY:
7. Peaceful Order (非攻, fēigōng)
- Conflict prevention
- Defensive capability
- Social stability
- Just protection

8. Collective Benefit (群利, qún lì)
- Social welfare
- Community good
- Shared prosperity
- Common advantage

RATIONAL GOVERNANCE:
9. Administrative Competence (治能, zhì néng)
- Effective management
- Practical leadership
- Technical skill
- Result-oriented governance

This shortlist captures:
- The practical orientation of Mohism
- Its focus on universal standards
- Its emphasis on measurable benefits
- Its rational approach to ethics
- Its concern for collective welfare

Each virtue selected represents either:
- A fundamental principle of Mohist thought
- A distinctive contribution to Chinese philosophy
- A practical application of Mohist ideals
- An essential aspect of their social vision

Would you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML+Markdown nodes for these nine core virtues?
