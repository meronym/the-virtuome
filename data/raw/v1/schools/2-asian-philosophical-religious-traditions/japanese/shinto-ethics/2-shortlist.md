Let me think through this systematically:

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:

1. Core Considerations:
- What makes Shinto ethics distinctive from other East Asian traditions?
- Which virtues are most frequently referenced in primary texts?
- Which virtues most directly influence daily practice?
- Which concepts are most foundational to other virtues?

2. Key Characteristics of Shinto Ethics:
- Emphasis on purity and sincerity over abstract moral rules
- Integration with natural world and kami
- Focus on harmonious relationships (human-divine-natural)
- Practical rather than theoretical orientation
- Embodied practice over philosophical doctrine

3. Historical Development:
- Indigenous Japanese practices
- Interaction with Buddhist and Confucian concepts
- Evolution through State Shinto period
- Modern interpretations and applications

4. Selection Criteria:
- Historical continuity
- Practical applicability
- Distinctiveness within East Asian traditions
- Foundational importance
- Contemporary relevance

REASONING FOR SELECTION:

1. Must include core purification virtues as these are fundamental to Shinto practice and worldview.

2. Must represent the relationship-oriented nature of Shinto (human-kami-nature triangle).

3. Should include both explicit ritual virtues and implicit social virtues.

4. Should capture both traditional and evolving aspects of the tradition.

5. Should reflect both individual and communal dimensions.
