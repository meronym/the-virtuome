Let me think through this systematically:

ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK:

1. DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF JAPANESE NEO-CONFUCIANISM:
- Practical rather than purely theoretical orientation
- Strong focus on social order and harmony
- Integration of Chinese Neo-Confucian thought with Japanese cultural values
- Emphasis on concrete application in governance and education
- Balance between personal cultivation and social responsibility

2. KEY SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Historical significance within the tradition
- Practical impact on Japanese society
- Distinctive Japanese interpretations of Confucian concepts
- Interconnectedness with other core virtues
- Continued relevance through Japanese history

3. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:
The selection should reflect:
- Both personal and social dimensions
- Both internal cultivation and external expression
- Both theoretical understanding and practical application
- The hierarchical nature of Japanese society
- The integration of learning and moral development

4. PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS:
The virtues should represent:
- The path of self-cultivation (修養 shūyō)
- Social harmony maintenance (和 wa)
- Proper relationships (分 bun)
- Moral education (教化 kyōka)
- Practical wisdom (知恵 chie)

- Links personal ethics with social relationships
- Critical for understanding Japanese social dynamics

5. 誠 (makoto) - Sincerity

6. 分別 (funbetsu) - Moral discrimination

The virtues are interconnected, with 修身 (self-cultivation) and 和 (harmony) serving as organizing principles around which the others operate. Together, they form a coherent system for understanding and developing human excellence in the Japanese Neo-Confucian tradition.
