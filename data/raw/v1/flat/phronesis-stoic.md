# Phronēsis (φρόνησις) - Practical Wisdom

## Definition
In Stoic philosophy, phronēsis represents the fundamental capacity for practical reason and moral judgment, enabling one to discern the right course of action in any situation.

## Key Aspects
- Discernment between what is and isn't in our control
- Correct judgment of impressions
- Application of reason to practical situations
- Understanding of natural law and cosmic order

## Historical Development
While rooted in earlier Greek philosophy, Stoic phronēsis emphasized practical application and moral development more than theoretical knowledge. Later Roman Stoics particularly stressed its role in daily decision-making.
