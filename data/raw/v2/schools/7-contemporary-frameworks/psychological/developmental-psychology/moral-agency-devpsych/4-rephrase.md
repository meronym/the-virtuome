Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: The capacity for ethical self-direction and responsible choice
Key functions: 
- Ethical discernment
- Value-aligned action
- Personal responsibility
- Moral identity integration
Developmental aspects:
- Progresses from external to internal regulation
- Builds on cognitive and emotional development
- Integrates with identity formation

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Making conscious choices
- Feeling responsibility
- Wrestling with right/wrong
- Experiencing moral emotions
Contemporary applications:
- Ethical decision-making
- Personal responsibility
- Social contribution
- Professional integrity

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Now crafting the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The innate human capacity to discern, choose, and act based on ethical understanding, integrating moral awareness with personal identity and behavioral choice. It represents our fundamental ability to recognize right from wrong, take responsibility for our actions, and actively shape our character through conscious choices.

[Essential Nature]
Moral agency emerges from the intersection of consciousness, choice, and responsibility. It manifests as our ability to recognize ethical dimensions in situations, deliberate on right action, and choose our response while accepting the consequences of our decisions. This capacity transcends mere rule-following, representing instead our fundamental power to shape ourselves and our world through ethically-informed action.

This quality integrates cognitive understanding, emotional awareness, and behavioral control into a coherent capacity for ethical self-direction. It develops through experience and reflection, gradually transforming from external guidance to internalized wisdom, becoming a core aspect of personal identity and human dignity.

[Manifestations]
- Conscious recognition of ethical dimensions in situations
- Deliberate consideration of right action despite competing pressures
- Acceptance of responsibility for choices and their consequences
- Integration of values into consistent patterns of behavior
- Active engagement in moral growth and character development
- Capacity to maintain ethical stance despite social pressure
- Expression of moral courage in challenging situations

[Functional Description]
Moral agency operates through a dynamic interplay of awareness, reflection, and choice. When faced with situations having ethical implications, it enables us to pause, recognize moral dimensions, consider alternatives, and choose actions aligned with our values. This capacity grows stronger through exercise, developing from simple recognition of rules to sophisticated ethical reasoning and ultimately to embodied wisdom expressing itself naturally in action.

In daily life, moral agency manifests as the continuous process of making conscious choices that shape our character and impact others. It enables us to resist harmful impulses, stand up for what we believe is right, take responsibility for our actions, and actively contribute to the ethical fabric of our communities. This capacity becomes particularly visible in challenging situations where competing values or pressures must be navigated.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: The description focuses on universal human experiences of choice, responsibility, and ethical awareness.
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language.
3. Practical applicability: Includes clear manifestations and real-world applications.
4. Individual-universal connection: Links personal choice to broader ethical impact.
5. Developmental clarity: Shows progression from basic to sophisticated expression.
6. Observable manifestations: Listed in concrete, verifiable terms.

This universal description captures the essence of moral agency while making it accessible and applicable across cultural contexts. It preserves the psychological sophistication of the original concept while expressing it in phenomenological rather than theoretical terms.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this description?
