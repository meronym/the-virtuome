Let me analyze Self-Regulation following our framework:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: The capacity to modulate internal states and external behaviors
Key functions: Response inhibition, attention control, emotional regulation
Relationship patterns: Affects all domains of functioning
Developmental aspects: Emerges early, refines throughout life

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences: Managing impulses, directing attention, handling emotions
Parallel concepts: Self-mastery, inner discipline, mindful control
Contemporary relevance: Essential for modern life's complexity
Timeless patterns: Progressive development of internal control

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The fundamental human capacity to consciously direct and modify one's internal states, responses, and behaviors. This enables purposeful engagement with life's demands while maintaining internal harmony and external effectiveness. It represents the bridge between impulse and action, intention and achievement.

[Essential Nature]
Self-regulation embodies the distinctly human ability to shape our responses rather than being shaped by them. It operates as an internal coordination system, harmonizing our immediate impulses with longer-term intentions, our emotional reactions with chosen responses, and our automatic patterns with conscious priorities. This capacity develops through progressive refinement of awareness and control, enabling increasingly sophisticated management of attention, emotion, and behavior.

Like a skilled conductor coordinating an orchestra, self-regulation orchestrates various internal processes to create coherent, intentional living. It represents not mere suppression of natural impulses, but rather their intelligent direction toward meaningful purposes.

[Manifestations]
- Peaceful pausing between stimulus and response
- Sustained attention toward chosen focuses despite distraction
- Emotional balance during challenging circumstances
- Consistent alignment of behavior with intentions
- Progressive adjustment of responses based on feedback
- Integration of immediate impulses with longer-term goals
- Flexible adaptation to changing situations while maintaining stability

[Functional Description]
Self-regulation operates through three interrelated mechanisms: awareness, modulation, and integration. Awareness provides the conscious recognition of internal states and external demands. Modulation enables adjusting the intensity and expression of responses. Integration coordinates multiple processes toward coherent functioning. This system develops through repeated cycles of challenge and successful adaptation, gradually expanding in sophistication and scope.

In daily life, this capacity manifests as the ability to stay focused despite distractions, remain balanced during emotional challenges, and maintain chosen courses of action despite competing impulses. It enables both moment-to-moment response management and longer-term pattern development, supporting everything from focused work to meaningful relationships. Each successful exercise of this capacity simultaneously employs and strengthens it, creating an upward spiral of increasing mastery.

This universal description:
1. Uses phenomenological language accessible across cultures
2. Preserves the sophisticated understanding from psychology
3. Connects to universal human experience
4. Shows clear developmental trajectory
5. Provides observable manifestations
6. Maintains practical applicability
7. Links individual functioning to universal patterns

The metaphor of the conductor helps make the abstract concept concrete while the description of mechanisms provides practical understanding. The emphasis on development maintains the psychological insight while the focus on daily manifestations ensures relevance.

Would you like me to revise any aspect to better meet our objectives?
