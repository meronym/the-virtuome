      "content": "Let me analyze this carefully.\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n\n1. Core Focus of Developmental Psychology:\n- Studies how virtues/capabilities emerge and mature over time\n- Emphasizes stage-wise progression\n- Recognizes interaction between individual and environment\n- Values both individual growth and social integration\n\n2. Key Selection Criteria:\n- Must represent different developmental domains (cognitive, social, emotional, moral)\n- Should be developmentally sequential\n- Must be empirically supported\n- Should have clear developmental trajectories\n- Must be culturally universal while allowing for cultural variation\n- Should be foundational for other virtues\n\n3. Integration Points:\n- Looking for virtues that bridge multiple theoretical frameworks\n- Considering both individual and relational aspects\n- Balancing self-development with social contribution\n- Including both early-emerging and mature capacities\n\n4. Special Considerations:\n- Some virtues are precursors to others\n- Some represent more mature integration of earlier capacities\n- Some are more fundamental to human development\n- Some have stronger empirical support\n\nPROPOSED SHORTLIST:\n\n1. Trust Capacity\n- Foundation for all relationship development\n- Erikson's first crisis resolution\n- Basis for secure attachment\n- Enables learning and growth\n\n2. Self-Regulation\n- Core developmental achievement\n- Underlies multiple competencies\n- Crucial for social adaptation\n- Developmentally progressive\n\n3. Empathic Understanding\n- Bridges self and other\n- Develops throughout lifespan\n- Cultural universal\n- Basis for moral development\n\n4. Perspective Integration\n- Cognitive-social milestone\n- Enables complex moral reasoning\n- Crucial for social adaptation\n- Develops sophistication over time\n\n5. Moral Agency\n- Combines judgment and action\n- Integrates multiple capacities\n- Developmentally sophisticated\n- Culturally informed but universal\n\n6. Adaptive Resilience\n- Dynamic developmental process\n- Integrates multiple systems\n- Grows through challenge\n- Enables sustained development\n\n7. Social Competence\n- Complex integration of skills\n- Developmentally sequential\n- Culturally embedded\n- Essential for human flourishing\n\n8. Generative Care\n- Mature integration of capacities\n- Contributes to society\n- Represents developmental achievement\n- Bridges individual and collective\n\nThis list aims to capture:\n- Developmental progression (from basic trust to generative care)\n- Multiple domains (cognitive, emotional, social, moral)\n- Both individual and relational aspects\n- Both early-emerging and mature capacities\n- Universal human potentials\n- Empirically supported constructs\n\nThe virtues are arranged in a somewhat developmental sequence, though they continue developing throughout life and interact with each other. Each represents a complex capacity that integrates multiple skills and abilities, rather than a simple trait.\n\nWould you like me to generate YAML nodes for these eight virtues, or would you prefer to refine the list first?"

Universalization Process\n- Identify universal human experiences it relates to\n- Find parallel concepts across contexts\n- Note contemporary relevance/applications\n- Identify timeless patterns/principles\n\n3. Structural Analysis\nPrimary Elements:\n- Essential nature/core function\n- Observable manifestations\n- Developmental trajectory\n- Systemic relationships\n\nSecondary Elements:\n- Common obstacles/challenges\n- Supporting conditions\n- Related qualities\n- Practical applications\n\nCOMPOSITION GUIDELINES:\n1. Language:\n- Use phenomenological rather than theoretical language\n- Prefer experiential descriptions over abstract concepts\n- Balance precision with accessibility\n- Avoid culture-specific references\n\n2. Structure:\n- Start with clearest, most fundamental aspect\n- Build complexity progressively\n- Connect abstract principles to concrete manifestations\n- Link individual to universal aspects\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```markdown\n[Core Definition]\nSingle paragraph capturing fundamental essence\n(50-75 words)\n\n[Essential Nature]\nDeeper elaboration of the quality's nature and function\n(100-150 words)\n\n[Manifestations]\n- Observable expressions (4-7 bullet points)\n- Developmental aspects\n- Practical implementations\n- Relationship patterns\n\n[Functional Description]\nHow this quality operates and develops in human experience\nTwo paragraphs:\n1. Operation/mechanism (75-100 words)\n2. Practical expression/impact (75-100 words)\n```\n\nQUALITY CRITERIA:\n1. Comprehensiveness:\n- Captures full depth of original concept\n- Addresses multiple dimensions (personal/interpersonal/universal)\n- Includes both theoretical and practical aspects\n\n2. Accessibility:\n- Understandable without specialized knowledge\n- Relatable to common experience\n- Practical and applicable\n\n3. Precision:\n- Clear differentiation from related concepts\n- Specific rather than vague descriptions\n- Accurate to original meaning\n\n4. Relevance:\n- Contemporary applications clear\n- Universal human significance evident\n- Practical value apparent\n\nVERIFICATION QUESTIONS:\n1. Would this description be meaningful across cultures?\n2. Does it preserve the depth of the original concept?\n3. Is it practically applicable?\n4. Does it connect individual to universal aspects?\n5. Is it clear how this quality develops?\n6. Are the manifestations observable/verifiable?\n\nUPDATED SCOPE: Please focus on the following virtue: Self-Regulation. Follow the provided preparation instructions, composition guidelines, and output format to create a universal language description of the virtue."
