Let me follow the process systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Integration of multiple aspects of human experience into coherent functioning
Key functions:
- Harmonization of different aspects of self
- Resolution of internal conflicts
- Coordination of various life dimensions
- Maintenance of dynamic balance
Developmental aspects:
- Progressive integration of new experiences
- Increasing complexity with maintained coherence
- Growing capacity for holding paradox
- Enhanced self-organization

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Sense of internal harmony vs fragmentation
- Need for coherence in life narrative
- Experience of integration vs compartmentalization
- Natural drive toward organization and wholeness
Contemporary applications:
- Personal development
- Stress management
- Decision-making
- Life balance
- Relationship integration

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary patterns:
- Movement from fragmentation to integration
- Balancing differentiation and unity
- Dynamic self-organization
- Adaptive flexibility with stable core

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain dynamic coherence across all dimensions of experience while integrating new elements and resolving tensions. It manifests as an ongoing process of harmonizing different aspects of self and life into an increasingly complex yet unified whole, allowing for both stability and growth.

[Essential Nature]
Integrative wholeness represents the natural tendency of human consciousness to organize experience into meaningful patterns while maintaining flexibility and openness to change. It operates as an active principle of self-organization, continuously balancing the needs for stability and growth, unity and diversity, structure and flow. This quality enables the emergence of increasingly complex levels of organization while maintaining fundamental coherence and authenticity.

Rather than a static state, it manifests as a dynamic process of continuous integration, where new experiences and aspects of self are incorporated into an evolving whole without losing their distinct qualities. This creates a form of unity that enhances rather than diminishes the richness of individual elements.

[Manifestations]
- Ability to hold and reconcile apparently contradictory aspects of experience
- Fluid movement between different roles and contexts while maintaining authenticity
- Natural coordination between thought, feeling, and action
- Capacity to integrate new experiences without losing core stability
- Balance between structure and flexibility in responding to life
- Progressive development of more complex yet harmonious ways of being
- Simultaneous awareness of detail and whole in any situation

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through an ongoing process of recognition, differentiation, and integration. When encountering new experiences or aspects of self, it first allows full recognition of their unique nature, then establishes their relationship to existing patterns, and finally incorporates them into a larger functional whole. This process maintains the integrity of individual elements while creating increasingly rich and complex patterns of organization.

In daily life, this manifests as the ability to move smoothly between different life domains while maintaining internal coherence, to adapt to new situations without losing one's center, and to grow through challenge without fragmentation. It enables one to hold multiple perspectives simultaneously, to integrate past experiences into present functioning, and to maintain balance while engaging with life's complexity. This quality supports both personal development and effective functioning in an increasingly complex world.

This universalized description:
1. Uses phenomenological language accessible across cultures
2. Preserves the sophisticated understanding from humanistic psychology
3. Connects to universal human experience
4. Maintains practical applicability
5. Shows clear developmental trajectory
6. Provides observable manifestations
7. Links individual experience to universal patterns

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect or adjust the description in any way?
