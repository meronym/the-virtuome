Let me follow the process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Receptive awareness to ongoing experience
Functions: 
- Permits direct contact with reality
- Facilitates learning and growth
- Enables authentic response
- Supports psychological flexibility

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Direct sensory perception
- Moment-to-moment awareness
- Natural curiosity/wonder
- Flow states
- Learning from experience

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Active receptivity
- Present-moment contact
- Non-defensive perception
- Experiential flexibility

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to remain receptively aware of ongoing experience as it unfolds, maintaining direct contact with reality without defensive filtering or conceptual overlay. This quality enables fresh perception, genuine learning, and authentic response to life's continuous unfolding.

[Essential Nature]
Experiential openness represents our innate ability to perceive and engage with reality directly, before mental categorization or emotional reaction shape our response. It manifests as a kind of alert receptivity that combines deep attention with psychological flexibility. This quality exists naturally in children's wonder and can be cultivated throughout life, supporting continuous growth and adaptation.

Like a clear lens that neither distorts nor filters incoming light, experiential openness allows reality to register in consciousness without predetermined patterns limiting what can be perceived or understood. It enables both detailed perception and holistic awareness, maintaining connection with the raw data of experience while remaining oriented within the larger context.

[Manifestations]
- Fresh perception of familiar situations, as if encountering them for the first time
- Fluid attention that follows experience without getting stuck or avoiding
- Natural curiosity about unfolding events, both internal and external
- Reduced defensive reactions to challenging experiences
- Capacity to learn directly from experience rather than only through concepts
- Enhanced ability to notice subtle aspects of experience
- Greater psychological flexibility in responding to situations

[Functional Description]
Experiential openness operates by maintaining a balanced state of alert receptivity where attention remains fluid rather than fixed or defensive. This creates a kind of psychological space where experience can register fully before automatic patterns of reaction engage. The quality develops through deliberately practicing present-moment awareness while gradually reducing habitual patterns of defensive filtering and conceptual overlay.

In practical terms, this quality enables continuous learning from experience, more accurate perception of reality, and greater response flexibility. It supports psychological growth by allowing new information to actually register and integrate rather than being filtered through existing patterns. This makes it essential for genuine development, creativity, and the capacity to navigate novel situations effectively.

This universalized description:
1. Uses phenomenological language accessible across cultures
2. Connects to universal human experiences
3. Maintains sophistication while being practically applicable
4. Preserves the depth of the original concept
5. Shows clear developmental trajectory
6. Provides observable manifestations
7. Links individual experience to universal patterns

The description should be meaningful across cultures as it refers to basic human capacities for perception and learning. It preserves the psychological sophistication of the original concept while making it accessible through experiential description rather than technical language.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the objectives?
