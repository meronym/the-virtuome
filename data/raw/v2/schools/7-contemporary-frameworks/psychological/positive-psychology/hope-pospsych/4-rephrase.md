Let me follow the process step by step for Hope.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Future-oriented positive expectancy combined with agency
Key functions:
- Goal visualization
- Pathway generation
- Motivation maintenance
- Resilience enablement
- Meaning creation

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Facing uncertainty
- Desiring positive outcomes
- Persisting through difficulty
- Finding ways forward
- Maintaining vision

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Forward-looking consciousness
- Agency/capability beliefs
- Path-finding capacity
- Emotional sustenance

Now, creating the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Hope is the human capacity to envision positive possibilities while maintaining the energy to pursue them, combining the ability to see potential paths forward with the sustained belief in one's capability to traverse them. It operates as both an emotional sustainer and a practical navigator of life's uncertainties.

[Essential Nature]
Hope functions as a fundamental life-orienting capacity that bridges present reality with future possibility. It integrates cognitive ability to generate pathways, emotional capacity to maintain positive expectancy, and volitional power to sustain movement toward desired outcomes. Unlike mere optimism, hope includes active engagement with shaping future circumstances, operating as both a vision-holding and path-creating force in human experience. It serves as a vital resource for maintaining coherent action toward meaningful aims despite uncertainty or obstacles.

[Manifestations]
- Persistent exploration of possibilities when faced with obstacles
- Maintained energy and engagement during challenging circumstances
- Active generation of alternative pathways toward desired outcomes
- Balanced assessment of difficulties while holding positive possibility
- Sustained movement toward meaningful aims despite uncertainty
- Resilient response to setbacks through renewed pathway generation
- Creative problem-solving energized by positive future vision

[Functional Description]
Hope operates through a dynamic interplay between vision and capability, where the ability to see positive possibilities strengthens the capacity to act, and successful action reinforces the ability to envision positive outcomes. This self-reinforcing cycle creates an upward spiral of expanded capability and possibility, supported by the development of practical skills in pathway generation and obstacle navigation.

In daily experience, hope manifests as the practical ability to maintain productive engagement with challenges while holding a broader perspective of positive possibility. It enables both immediate problem-solving and long-term perseverance by providing an emotional foundation for sustained effort while facilitating the practical generation of new approaches and solutions. This combination of emotional sustenance and practical agency makes hope a vital resource for human development and achievement.

This universalized description:
1. Maintains the sophistication of hope theory (pathway + agency)
2. Connects to universal human experience of facing uncertainty
3. Balances emotional and practical aspects
4. Provides observable manifestations
5. Explains developmental dynamics
6. Offers practical relevance

The description preserves the core insights of positive psychology while making them accessible through universal human experiences and observable manifestations. It maintains both theoretical depth and practical applicability while avoiding culture-specific references.

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural meaning ✓ (focuses on universal human experiences)
2. Preserves depth ✓ (maintains sophisticated understanding of hope's dual nature)
3. Practical applicability ✓ (clear manifestations and functional description)
4. Individual-universal connection ✓ (links personal experience to universal capacity)
5. Development clarity ✓ (explains self-reinforcing cycle)
6. Observable manifestations ✓ (concrete, verifiable expressions)

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
