Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Meta-cognitive capacity to recognize and cultivate positive human qualities
Key functions: Self-knowledge, development facilitation, strength deployment
Relationship patterns: Enables other virtues, bridges potential and actualization
Developmental aspects: Progressive refinement of self-awareness and application skill

UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS:
Universal experiences:
- Self-discovery
- Personal growth
- Capability recognition
- Skill development
- Pattern recognition in behavior

Parallel concepts across contexts:
- Self-knowledge traditions
- Skill mastery frameworks
- Personal development systems
- Talent recognition approaches

Here's my attempt at the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, understand, and intentionally develop one's inherent positive qualities. It combines deep self-awareness with the ability to identify situations where these qualities can be effectively expressed and strengthened, leading to personal growth and meaningful contribution.

[Essential Nature]
Character Strength Awareness operates as a meta-capacity that bridges self-knowledge and personal development. It encompasses both the recognition of existing capabilities and the understanding of their potential for growth. This awareness functions as an internal compass, helping identify opportunities for authentic expression and meaningful action while guiding personal development efforts toward natural areas of excellence.

Unlike fixed self-concepts, it represents a dynamic understanding that evolves through experience and reflection, constantly integrating new insights about one's capabilities and their applications. This quality enables the translation of abstract potential into concrete expression through conscious cultivation and strategic deployment of personal strengths.

[Manifestations]
- Recognition of recurring patterns in one's most successful or fulfilling experiences
- Natural gravitation toward certain types of challenges or activities
- Intuitive understanding of situations where one can make unique contributions
- Capacity to match personal qualities to situational demands
- Growing appreciation of previously unrecognized capabilities
- Ability to articulate one's strengths without arrogance or false modesty
- Recognition of development opportunities aligned with natural inclinations

[Functional Description]
This capacity operates through an ongoing cycle of observation, recognition, and experimentation. It begins with noticing patterns in one's natural responses and successful experiences, develops through conscious reflection on these patterns, and matures through intentional testing and refinement of understood strengths in new contexts. This process gradually builds an increasingly sophisticated internal map of one's capabilities and their optimal applications.

In practical terms, this awareness manifests as an intuitive sense of where and how one can best contribute, combined with the practical wisdom to develop these capacities effectively. It enables more authentic self-expression, more effective personal development efforts, and more meaningful contributions to shared endeavors. This quality serves as both a guide for individual growth and a bridge between personal potential and practical impact.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: The description focuses on universal human experiences of self-discovery and development
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible
3. Practical applicability: Includes concrete manifestations and practical functioning
4. Individual-universal connection: Links personal qualities to broader human development
5. Developmental clarity: Describes progressive refinement through experience and reflection
6. Observable manifestations: Listed in concrete, verifiable terms

The description aims to capture the sophisticated meta-cognitive nature of this quality while making it accessible through universal human experiences of self-discovery and development. It preserves the depth of the positive psychology concept while translating it into more universally applicable language.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this description?
