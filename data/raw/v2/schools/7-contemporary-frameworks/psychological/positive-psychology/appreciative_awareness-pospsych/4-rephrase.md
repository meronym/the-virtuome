Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Integration of mindful presence with active value recognition
Key functions: 
- Enhances experience quality
- Deepens engagement with present moment
- Cultivates meaning recognition
- Builds positive memory networks
- Strengthens value awareness

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Moments of being struck by beauty
- Deep engagement with present experience
- Recognition of meaning in everyday moments
- Sense of connection to larger wholes
- Natural human capacity for wonder

STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Present-moment receptivity
- Active value recognition
- Experience enrichment
- Meaning awareness
Secondary:
- Attention regulation
- Emotional receptivity
- Value sensitivity
- Experiential depth

Here's my attempt at the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to remain fully present while actively recognizing and deeply engaging with value in immediate experience. It combines alert receptivity with appreciative engagement, allowing for richer experience of life's inherent meaning and beauty in both ordinary and extraordinary moments.

[Essential Nature]
Appreciative awareness represents the mind's natural ability to both notice and engage deeply with what is meaningful, beautiful, or valuable in our immediate experience. It functions as a bridge between simple presence and rich engagement, transforming ordinary perception into meaningful experience. This quality emerges from the interaction between our capacity for present-moment attention and our innate ability to recognize value and meaning, creating a more vibrant and textured experience of life.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous recognition of beauty in everyday scenes
- Heightened engagement with sensory experiences
- Natural pausing to absorb meaningful moments
- Deepened appreciation of ordinary experiences
- Recognition of value in mundane situations
- Increased sensitivity to subtle qualities
- Enhanced memory formation of positive experiences

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dual process of receptive attention and active appreciation. The receptive component maintains open, present-moment awareness, while the appreciative component actively engages with the inherent value and meaning within experience. This interaction creates a self-reinforcing cycle where increased presence enhances appreciation, and deeper appreciation naturally strengthens presence.

In practice, this quality transforms everyday experience by enriching perceptual and emotional engagement with life. It naturally counteracts habituation and taken-for-granted attitudes, continuously refreshing our experience of familiar situations and relationships. This ongoing renewal of perception and appreciation creates a richer, more meaningful experience of life while building lasting positive mental and emotional resources.

This universalized description aims to:
1. Capture the phenomenon in experiential rather than theoretical terms
2. Connect to universal human capacities
3. Maintain practical relevance
4. Preserve sophistication while ensuring accessibility
5. Support development through clear understanding of function

Would you like me to adjust any aspects to better meet the objectives?
