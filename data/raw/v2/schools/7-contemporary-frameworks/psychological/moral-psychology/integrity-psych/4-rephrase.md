Let me follow the process step by step:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Integration/wholeness of character and action
Key functions: Alignment maintenance, congruence assurance, ethical consistency
Relationship patterns: Self-to-values, values-to-action, internal-to-external
Developmental aspects: Progressive integration of values, growing congruence capacity

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences: Inner-outer alignment, authenticity, consistency challenges
Parallel concepts: Wholeness, truthfulness, congruence, authenticity
Contemporary relevance: Personal authenticity, ethical leadership, trust-building
Timeless patterns: Value-action alignment, self-consistency, truthful living

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Core function: Maintaining wholeness between inner truth and outer expression
Manifestations: Consistent behavior, truthful expression, value adherence
Development: From simple honesty to complex value integration
Systemic role: Foundation for trust, authentic relationship, ethical reliability

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain wholeness between inner truth and outer expression, manifesting as consistent alignment between values, words, and actions. It enables authentic living through faithful adherence to one's deepest understanding of what is right, even in challenging circumstances.

[Essential Nature]
Integrity functions as an integrative force that maintains coherence between our inner world of values, beliefs, and principles, and our outer world of speech, choices, and actions. Like a bridge connecting inner truth to outer expression, it ensures that what we most deeply know and believe manifests faithfully in how we live and act. This quality generates trust, both in oneself and from others, by creating reliable patterns of behavior that reflect genuine inner conviction rather than mere social compliance or situational advantage.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent alignment between stated values and observable actions
- Truthful self-expression even when personally costly
- Reliable follow-through on commitments and promises
- Maintenance of ethical standards regardless of external pressure
- Authentic representation of one's beliefs and limitations
- Integration of new understanding into existing value framework
- Steady behavior patterns that reflect core principles

[Functional Description]
Integrity operates through continuous internal monitoring and alignment processes, comparing current choices and actions against established values and principles. It acts as both a compass and a stabilizing force, helping navigate complex situations while maintaining coherence between inner conviction and outer behavior. This quality develops through progressive integration of experience, reflection, and conscious choice-making.

In daily life, integrity manifests as a reliable pattern of behavior that others can trust and depend upon. It creates a foundation for meaningful relationships, effective leadership, and sustainable achievement by ensuring that short-term actions align with long-term values and aspirations. This alignment generates both internal peace and external trust, enabling authentic participation in human communities.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the psychological depth of the original concept
2. Uses experiential rather than theoretical language
3. Connects individual experience to universal patterns
4. Maintains practical applicability
5. Describes observable manifestations
6. Outlines clear development patterns
7. Links personal to interpersonal impacts

Would you like me to:
1. Further elaborate any specific aspect?
2. Provide more concrete examples?
3. Develop additional practical applications?
4. Explore developmental stages in more detail?
