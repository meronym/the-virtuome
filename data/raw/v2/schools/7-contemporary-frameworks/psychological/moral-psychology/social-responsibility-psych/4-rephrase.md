Let me follow the process systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Recognition and actualization of collective interdependence
Key functions: 
- Connecting individual to collective welfare
- Enabling coordinated social action
- Supporting sustainable social systems
- Facilitating collective problem-solving

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Group membership and belonging
- Mutual dependence
- Collective challenges
- Shared resources management
- Community contribution

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary elements:
- Recognition of interconnection
- Response to collective needs
- Sustainable action patterns
- System-level awareness

Now, the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, care for, and actively contribute to the welfare of the broader human community, stemming from deep understanding of our fundamental interconnectedness and expressing through conscious participation in collective flourishing.

[Essential Nature]
Social responsibility emerges from the recognition that human existence is inherently interconnected, where individual and collective wellbeing are inseparably linked. It manifests as an expanding sphere of care and consideration, moving from immediate connections to broader circles of human community, and ultimately to the whole of life's web of relationships.

This quality combines awareness of collective impact with active commitment to positive contribution. It develops through growing recognition of interdependence, deepening appreciation of collective needs, and increasing capacity for meaningful participation in community welfare.

[Manifestations]
- Conscious consideration of how personal choices affect others
- Active participation in addressing collective challenges
- Voluntary contribution to community wellbeing
- Sustainable resource use and management
- Care for future generations' welfare
- Balanced integration of individual and collective needs
- Proactive support for vulnerable community members

[Functional Description]
Social responsibility operates through a dynamic interplay of awareness, care, and action. It begins with recognition of interconnection, develops through deepening understanding of collective impacts, and matures into skilled navigation of individual-collective relationships. This quality grows through expanding circles of consideration, from immediate to universal, supported by developing capacity for systemic thinking and long-term perspective.

In practice, this quality enables individuals to participate meaningfully in collective life while maintaining healthy boundaries. It supports sustainable decision-making, facilitates cooperative problem-solving, and enables effective response to shared challenges. The quality manifests differently across contexts but consistently serves to align individual action with collective wellbeing, creating resilient and thriving communities.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Uses universal human experiences of interconnection and community
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language
3. Practical applicability: Includes concrete manifestations and functional descriptions
4. Individual-universal connection: Links personal awareness to collective impact
5. Developmental clarity: Shows progression from recognition to active participation
6. Observable manifestations: Listed in concrete, verifiable terms

Would you like me to:
1. Expand any particular section?
2. Add more practical examples?
3. Clarify the developmental aspects further?
4. Strengthen any specific element of universality?
