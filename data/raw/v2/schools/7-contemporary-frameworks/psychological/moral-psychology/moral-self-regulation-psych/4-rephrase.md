Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: The capacity to align behavior with moral understanding
Key functions: 
- Bridging intention-action gap
- Maintaining ethical consistency
- Resisting contrary impulses
- Sustaining moral effort
- Monitoring moral alignment

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Inner conflict between desires and principles
- Effort to maintain consistent behavior
- Need to resist immediate gratification
- Experience of moral willpower
- Self-monitoring and adjustment

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary relationships:
- Enables moral intention â†’ action
- Supports consistent character
- Facilitates moral development
- Enables reliable virtue

Now, here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The innate human capacity to guide and adjust one's behavior to align with understood moral truths, involving the recognition, regulation, and refinement of impulses, habits, and actions in service of ethical living. This faculty enables the consistent expression of moral understanding through practical action.

[Essential Nature]
This fundamental human capacity operates at the intersection of knowing and doing, serving as the bridge between moral understanding and practical action. It manifests as an inner faculty of recognition and regulation, through which we become aware of the gap between our ethical ideals and actual behavior, and develop the strength to narrow this gap through conscious effort and practiced alignment.

This capacity develops through the interplay of awareness, effort, and refinement, growing stronger through intentional exercise and challenged through confrontation with competing impulses and desires. It represents the essential human ability to shape behavior according to higher understanding, rather than being driven solely by immediate impulses or external pressures.

[Manifestations]
- Conscious pause between impulse and action, allowing for ethical consideration
- Sustained effort to maintain alignment with understood principles despite difficulty
- Regular self-reflection on the consistency between values and actions
- Progressive refinement of behavioral patterns to better match moral understanding
- Increased capacity to maintain ethical behavior under challenging circumstances
- Development of supportive habits and practices that facilitate moral action
- Growing awareness of subtle departures from moral ideals

[Functional Description]
This capacity operates through a continuous cycle of awareness, choice, and adjustment. It begins with the recognition of discrepancy between current behavior and moral understanding, followed by the conscious application of effort to bring action into alignment. Through repeated exercise, it develops into increasingly refined patterns of recognition and response, ultimately enabling more consistent ethical behavior even under challenging circumstances.

In practical expression, this capacity manifests as the ability to maintain ethical behavior despite contrary impulses or external pressures. It enables the development of moral character through consistent action, the formation of supportive habits, and the progressive refinement of behavior to better match moral understanding. This faculty grows stronger through intentional exercise and challenges, much like a muscle strengthening through use.

This universalized description aims to:
- Capture the essence of moral self-regulation without culture-specific references
- Connect to universal human experiences of moral effort and development
- Maintain practical applicability while preserving philosophical depth
- Describe observable manifestations and development patterns
- Link individual experience to universal human capacity

Would you like me to:
1. Further refine any particular aspect?
2. Expand on specific manifestations?
3. Elaborate on development patterns?
4. Add practical application examples?
