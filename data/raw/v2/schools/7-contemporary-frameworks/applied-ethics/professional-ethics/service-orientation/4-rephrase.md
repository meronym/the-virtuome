Let me follow the process systematically:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Active orientation toward benefiting others through professional capacity
Key functions: 
- Directs professional skill toward social benefit
- Prioritizes others' welfare over self-interest
- Creates value through expertise
- Maintains accessibility of professional services

UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS:
Universal experiences:
- Helping others through capability
- Contributing to community wellbeing
- Using skills for collective benefit
- Finding purpose through service

Based on this analysis, here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The sustained orientation of one's capabilities and efforts toward benefiting others, characterized by the intentional use of knowledge, skills, and position to create value for individuals and society while subordinating personal gain to service effectiveness.

[Essential Nature]
Service orientation manifests as an internal compass that consistently directs personal capabilities toward social benefit. It transcends mere professional duty, emerging as a fundamental way of relating to others through one's work and abilities. This orientation transforms technical expertise and professional power from potential sources of personal advantage into instruments of collective wellbeing.

At its core, it represents the mature integration of capability with purpose, where increasing mastery leads naturally to expanding service rather than accumulating advantage. This quality develops through progressive recognition of interconnection and the inherent satisfaction found in meaningful contribution.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent prioritization of others' welfare in professional decisions
- Active identification of opportunities to apply expertise for community benefit
- Voluntary expansion of service accessibility beyond minimum requirements
- Development of capabilities explicitly aimed at enhanced service provision
- Natural gravitation toward unmet needs within one's sphere of influence
- Integration of service efficiency with genuine care for outcomes
- Regular evaluation of impact and adjustment of approach to maximize benefit

[Functional Description]
Service orientation operates through a dynamic interplay between growing capability and expanding contribution. As expertise develops, it naturally seeks expression through service rather than advantage, creating a self-reinforcing cycle where service experience enhances capability while capability enhances service potential. This quality actively transforms professional relationships from transactional exchanges into opportunities for meaningful contribution.

In practice, it manifests as consistent attention to others' needs and continuous refinement of service effectiveness. It shapes decision-making by automatically considering impact on others, guides professional development toward enhanced service capability, and generates satisfaction through successful contribution rather than personal gain. This orientation naturally builds trust and strengthens professional relationships while creating sustainable value for society.
