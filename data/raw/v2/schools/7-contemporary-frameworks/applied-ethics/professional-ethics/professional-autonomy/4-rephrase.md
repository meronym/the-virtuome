Let me work through this systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Self-directed judgment within ethical bounds
Key functions:
- Independent decision-making
- Resistance to improper influence
- Ethical self-governance
- Professional boundary maintenance

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Making independent choices under constraints
- Balancing freedom with responsibility
- Standing firm against pressure
- Exercising judgment in complex situations

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary patterns:
- Development of judgment capacity
- Integration of knowledge and ethics
- Balance of independence and accountability
- Management of competing pressures

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to exercise independent judgment while maintaining responsibility to broader principles and collective welfare. It manifests as the ability to make sound decisions autonomously while recognizing and honoring the boundaries and obligations inherent in one's role and relationships.

[Essential Nature]
Autonomous judgment represents the mature integration of independence and responsibility. It emerges from the development of internal guidance systems that can reliably navigate complex situations while maintaining alignment with ethical principles and collective needs. This quality combines self-trust with clear recognition of responsibilities and limitations, enabling decisive action that serves both immediate needs and broader purposes.

This form of autonomy differs from mere independence by incorporating awareness of interconnection and responsibility. It represents the capacity to stand firm when needed while remaining responsive to valid constraints and obligations.

[Manifestations]
- Confident decision-making in ambiguous situations
- Principled resistance to inappropriate influence or pressure
- Clear recognition and maintenance of role boundaries
- Integration of personal judgment with collective standards
- Balance of independence with accountability
- Active engagement with ethical principles in decision-making
- Measured response to competing demands and expectations

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic balance of internal and external reference points. It develops through progressive integration of personal judgment capacity with understanding of broader contexts and responsibilities. The individual learns to trust their discernment while remaining attuned to relevant constraints and considerations, creating a stable foundation for independent action that serves both individual and collective needs.

In practice, this manifests as the ability to make clear decisions in complex situations while maintaining appropriate relationships and responsibilities. It enables individuals to navigate challenging circumstances with confidence while avoiding both rigid independence and excessive dependence on external guidance. This capacity proves essential in roles requiring reliable judgment amidst competing pressures and demands.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: The description focuses on universal experiences of judgment and responsibility
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding of autonomy while making it accessible
3. Practical applicability: Includes clear manifestations and operational description
4. Individual-universal connection: Links personal judgment to collective welfare
5. Developmental clarity: Describes progressive integration of capacity
6. Observable manifestations: Listed in concrete, verifiable terms

Would you like me to:
1. Expand any particular aspect?
2. Adjust the balance of abstract/concrete elements?
3. Add specific examples?
4. Strengthen particular connections?
