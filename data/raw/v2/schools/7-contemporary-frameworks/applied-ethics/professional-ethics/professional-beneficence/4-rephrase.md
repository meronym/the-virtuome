Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Active promotion of good/benefit through intentional action
Key functions: 
- Guiding positive action
- Balancing individual/collective benefit
- Motivating service orientation
- Directing professional expertise toward beneficial outcomes

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Desire to help others
- Satisfaction in creating positive impact
- Recognition of capacity to benefit others
- Sense of responsibility stemming from capability

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Essential nature: Active orientation toward creating benefit
Observable manifestations: Help-giving, service, positive impact
Developmental trajectory: From simple helping to sophisticated benefit-creation
Systemic relationships: Links individual capacity to social benefit

Now, the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The active orientation toward creating benefit for others, expressed through the intentional application of one's capabilities, knowledge, and resources to promote individual and collective wellbeing. This quality manifests as both the disposition to help and the skilled execution of beneficial action.

[Essential Nature]
Beneficence represents the development of human capacity for positive impact, extending beyond mere good intention to encompass skilled benefit-creation. It emerges from the recognition that personal capabilities carry implicit responsibilities, combining the natural human inclination to help with developed ability to effectively promote wellbeing. This quality integrates emotional resonance with others' needs, practical capability to help, and wisdom in determining appropriate beneficial action.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous recognition of opportunities to benefit others
- Skilled application of capabilities toward positive outcomes
- Active seeking of ways to promote individual and collective wellbeing
- Development of capacity to create sustainable benefit
- Integration of helping intention with practical effectiveness
- Balance of immediate aid with long-term positive impact
- Cultivation of systems and structures that enable broader benefit

[Functional Description]
Beneficence operates through a dynamic interaction between awareness, capability, and action. It begins with recognition of opportunities to create benefit, develops through the cultivation of relevant skills and understanding, and manifests in increasingly sophisticated forms of positive impact. This quality grows through the integration of natural helping impulses with developed expertise and wisdom about effective benefit-creation.

In practice, beneficence expresses itself through both immediate helping actions and sustained efforts to create positive change. It guides the development of professional expertise, shapes the application of skills and resources, and influences the design of systems and processes. This quality transforms natural human helping capacity into sophisticated ability to promote wellbeing at multiple levels, from individual interaction to systemic change.

This universalized description:
1. Maintains the depth of the professional ethics concept while making it accessible
2. Links individual experience to universal human capacity
3. Preserves sophistication while using phenomenological language
4. Makes clear both development pathway and practical manifestations
5. Connects immediate helping to systemic benefit-creation
6. Emphasizes both disposition and skilled execution

The description should be meaningful across cultures as it:
- Focuses on universal human experiences
- Uses observable phenomena as reference points
- Emphasizes practical manifestations
- Links individual capacity to collective benefit
- Describes clear development pathways
- Maintains sophistication while remaining accessible

Would you like me to:
1. Expand any particular aspect?
2. Provide more specific examples?
3. Elaborate on development pathways?
4. Clarify relationships with other virtues?
