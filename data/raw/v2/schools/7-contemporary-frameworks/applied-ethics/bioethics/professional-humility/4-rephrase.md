Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Recognition of knowledge/capability limitations and continuous growth orientation
Key functions: 
- Error prevention
- Learning facilitation
- Collaboration enablement
- Quality improvement
- Trust building

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Learning from mistakes
- Recognizing personal limitations
- Seeking help/guidance
- Growing through feedback
- Collaborative problem-solving

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The mature capacity to maintain clear awareness of one's limitations while actively engaging in continuous learning and growth. This quality enables honest self-assessment, openness to feedback, recognition of others' contributions, and the integration of new understanding into expanding capability.

[Essential Nature]
Professional humility emerges from the intersection of self-awareness and growth orientation. It manifests as a dynamic balance between confidence in current capabilities and conscious recognition of their boundaries. This quality creates a perpetual learning stance that enhances both individual development and collective wisdom.

Unlike simple modesty or self-deprecation, it represents a clear-eyed assessment of one's current position within a larger field of knowledge and capability, combined with active engagement in expansion and refinement. It serves as both a protective function against errors of overconfidence and a generative force for continued development.

[Manifestations]
- Readily acknowledging knowledge gaps and seeking assistance when needed
- Maintaining receptivity to feedback and new information even in areas of expertise
- Engaging genuinely with others' perspectives and potential contributions
- Balancing confident action with continuous refinement and adjustment
- Supporting others' development through sharing both successes and learning experiences
- Demonstrating transparency about limitations and mistakes to foster collective learning

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through continuous cycles of self-assessment, external engagement, and integration. It maintains a dynamic balance between competence and learning orientation by regularly testing assumptions against reality and actively seeking disconfirming information. The quality creates psychological safety for both self and others by normalizing limitations as opportunities for growth rather than failures to hide.

In practice, it enables more effective collaboration, reduced error rates, and accelerated learning across systems. It creates environments where questions are welcomed, mistakes are learned from, and collective wisdom can emerge. This quality serves as a foundation for sustainable excellence by preventing stagnation and enabling continuous adaptation to new challenges and information.
