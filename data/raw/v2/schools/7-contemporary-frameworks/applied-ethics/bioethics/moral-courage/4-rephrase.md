Let me follow the process step by step.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: The capacity to act according to ethical convictions despite resistance or risk
Key functions: 
- Protection of ethical principles
- Defense of vulnerable parties
- Maintenance of professional integrity
- Challenge to unethical systems/practices
Relationship patterns: Bridges individual ethics and collective welfare
Developmental aspects: Grows through conscious practice and challenged encounters

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Standing up against wrong
- Protecting others despite personal risk
- Maintaining integrity under pressure
- Speaking truth to power
Contemporary relevance: Increasingly crucial in complex organizational systems
Timeless patterns: The tension between personal safety and ethical action

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The inner strength that enables one to take needed action in alignment with ethical understanding despite personal risk, social pressure, or potential negative consequences. It manifests as the capacity to stand firm in service of what one recognizes as right, especially when facing opposition or threat.

[Essential Nature]
Moral courage represents the bridge between ethical understanding and ethical action. It is the quality that transforms moral knowledge into moral deed, especially when such action carries personal cost. Unlike physical courage, which responds to immediate threats, moral courage engages with ethical challenges that often involve complex social dynamics, institutional pressures, and long-term consequences. It combines clear ethical perception with the strength to act on that perception, even when easier alternatives are available.

[Manifestations]
- Speaking truth in situations where silence would be easier or safer
- Taking action to protect others despite personal or professional risk
- Maintaining ethical standards when under pressure to compromise
- Challenging established practices that violate ethical principles
- Standing alone in defense of principle when others remain passive
- Accepting personal consequences for ethical choices
- Persisting in ethical action despite opposition or ridicule

[Functional Description]
Moral courage operates through a dynamic interaction between ethical clarity and internal strength. It begins with recognition of ethical imperrative, crystallizes through internal alignment with principle, and manifests through decisive action despite countervailing pressures. This quality develops through progressive challenges, each instance of ethical action building capacity for future encounters with moral challenge.

In practice, moral courage transforms potential ethical action into actual ethical intervention. It functions as both protector and activator of other virtues, ensuring they find expression even in hostile environments. The presence of moral courage in individuals and systems creates spaces where ethical behavior becomes more possible for others, gradually expanding the sphere of ethical action within human systems.

This universal description aims to:
1. Capture the essence without relying on healthcare-specific context
2. Connect individual experience to collective impact
3. Emphasize observable manifestations
4. Clarify developmental patterns
5. Maintain accessibility while preserving depth

The description should resonate across cultures because it:
- Focuses on universal human experiences
- Avoids culture-specific references
- Emphasizes observable phenomena
- Links individual to collective aspects
- Maintains practical applicability

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universal description?
