Let me follow the analytical process step by step:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Engaged attentiveness in healing relationships
Functions: 
- Creates safe therapeutic space
- Enables authentic connection
- Facilitates healing
- Supports accurate assessment
- Maintains human element in technical care

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Being fully seen/heard by another
- Feeling supported during vulnerability
- Experiencing focused attention
- Sensing authentic connection
- Receiving undivided attention

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary patterns:
- Quality of attention
- Authenticity of presence
- Integration of technical/human elements
- Real-time responsiveness
- Sustained engagement

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain complete, conscious engagement with another's experience while skillfully responding to their needs. It combines focused attention, emotional availability, and technical competence within a unified state of responsive awareness that creates optimal conditions for healing and support.

[Essential Nature]
Therapeutic presence emerges when technical skill and human connection merge into a singular state of engaged awareness. It transcends mere physical proximity or professional attention, manifesting as a quality of being that creates a safe container for vulnerability and healing. This presence combines moment-to-moment attentiveness with skilled responsiveness, maintaining simultaneous awareness of both immediate details and broader patterns while remaining genuinely available for authentic human connection.

[Manifestations]
- Sustained, responsive attention that adapts to changing needs without breaking engagement
- Integration of technical observation with empathetic understanding
- Creation of psychological safety through consistent, genuine availability
- Balanced awareness of both immediate details and broader context
- Fluid alternation between focused intervention and receptive presence
- Observable calibration of engagement level to match situational needs
- Maintenance of authentic connection during technical procedures

[Functional Description]
Therapeutic presence operates through synchronized activation of technical competence and interpersonal awareness, creating a unified state where professional skill and human connection enhance rather than compete with each other. This integration enables simultaneous tracking of multiple dimensions – physical, emotional, and technical – while maintaining genuine human connection. The quality develops through deliberate practice of present-moment awareness combined with progressive refinement of professional skill.

In practice, therapeutic presence manifests as a tangible shift in the quality of interaction, creating a space where healing and support can occur optimally. Recipients experience being truly seen and heard while receiving skilled care, leading to enhanced trust, improved outcomes, and more accurate assessment of needs. This presence serves as a counterbalance to mechanical efficiency, ensuring that human connection remains central within technical excellence.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the core meaning while making it accessible beyond healthcare
2. Maintains practical applicability across helping relationships
3. Describes observable manifestations
4. Links individual practice to universal human experience
5. Details developmental aspects
6. Provides clear functional understanding

The description should be meaningful across cultures while preserving the sophistication of the original bioethical concept. It connects individual practice to universal human experiences of presence and support while remaining practically applicable in various contexts.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this universalization?
