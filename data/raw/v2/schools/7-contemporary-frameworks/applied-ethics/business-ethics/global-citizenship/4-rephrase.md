Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Conscious participation in global human community
Key functions:
- Cross-cultural understanding and bridge-building
- Recognition of shared human challenges/destiny
- Responsible action considering global impact
- Integration of local and global perspectives

Relationship patterns:
- Individual → Local community → Global community
- Personal actions ↔ Global consequences
- Cultural specificity ↔ Universal values
- Local knowledge → Global wisdom

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Recognition of human commonality across differences
- Sense of belonging to larger human family
- Awareness of interconnected consequences
- Care extending beyond immediate sphere

3. STRUCTURAL INTEGRATION

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to understand, feel, and act from awareness of our membership in the global human community, combining local and universal perspectives while recognizing the interconnected nature of human challenges and possibilities across cultural and geographical boundaries.

[Essential Nature]
Global citizenship manifests as an expanding circle of awareness and care, where personal identity naturally extends to encompass humanity's collective journey. It represents the development of consciousness beyond immediate tribal, cultural, or national boundaries while maintaining authentic connection to local contexts and immediate communities.

This quality enables navigation between universal human principles and diverse cultural expressions, fostering the ability to discover unity in diversity and to act from awareness of our shared human heritage and destiny. It combines deep respect for cultural particularity with recognition of universal human experiences and needs.

[Manifestations]
- Natural recognition of human commonality across cultural differences
- Spontaneous consideration of broader impacts beyond immediate sphere
- Fluid movement between local and global perspectives
- Integration of cultural specificity with universal principles
- Active engagement with global challenges through local action
- Development of cross-cultural understanding and bridge-building capacity
- Expression of care and responsibility extending to global community

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive expansion of identity and care, beginning with direct experience of human commonality across cultural boundaries. As awareness grows, one naturally begins to consider broader impacts of actions and recognize patterns of interconnection. This evolution leads to increasingly skillful navigation between local and global contexts, supported by growing capacity to hold multiple perspectives simultaneously.

In practical expression, global citizenship manifests as natural consideration of broader impacts in daily decisions, spontaneous recognition of human commonality across differences, and authentic engagement with both local and global challenges. It enables effective cross-cultural collaboration while maintaining deep respect for diversity, expressing as practical wisdom in navigating our interconnected world.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Uses universal human experiences and observations rather than culture-specific concepts
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language
3. Practical applicability: Links to observable behaviors and clear development path
4. Individual-universal connection: Shows clear progression from personal to universal
5. Development clarity: Describes natural evolution of the quality
6. Observable manifestations: Listed in concrete, verifiable terms

The description aims to transform a modern business ethics concept into universal human terms while maintaining its essential sophistication and practical relevance. It emphasizes experiential understanding over theoretical frameworks and connects individual development to collective human challenges.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization attempt?
