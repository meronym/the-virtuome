Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Integrity:

Core principle: Wholeness/coherence between inner values and outer actions
Key functions:
- Maintains internal-external alignment
- Builds trust through consistency
- Guides decision-making
- Stabilizes character
- Creates reliability

Systemic roles:
- Foundation for trust-based relationships
- Enabler of sustainable cooperation
- Quality assurance for ethical behavior
- Stabilizing force in social systems

2. UNIVERSALIZATION ANALYSIS:

Universal experiences:
- Inner sense of coherence/discord
- Pressure to compromise values
- Need for reliable relationships
- Desire for authentic expression
- Experience of moral certainty

Timeless patterns:
- Value-action alignment
- Character consistency
- Truth-speaking
- Promise-keeping
- Self-congruence

3. Now, crafting the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of maintaining consistent alignment between one's deepest values and outward actions, creating a state of wholeness where thought, word, and deed form a unified expression of one's authentic nature. This alignment generates trust, enables reliable relationships, and provides inner stability amid external pressures.

[Essential Nature]
Integrity manifests as an inner force that maintains coherence between what we truly value and how we actually live. It operates as an active principle of integration, continuously aligning our choices with our core values despite external pressures or personal temptations. This quality creates a distinctive kind of wholeness in human character - one where inner conviction and outer action become seamlessly unified, generating a natural authority that others recognize and trust.

This unification of inner and outer aspects of self serves as a fundamental organizing principle for human character, much like a spine provides structure and support for the body while enabling flexible movement and adaptation to changing circumstances.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent alignment between stated values and observable actions
- Natural authority that emerges from authentic self-expression
- Reliable behavior patterns that build trust over time
- Resistance to compromise core values under pressure
- Clear decision-making guided by integrated value system
- Capacity to maintain ethical stance despite personal cost
- Observable congruence between private and public behavior

[Functional Description]
Integrity operates through a continuous process of internal monitoring and alignment, where each situation is measured against core values before action is taken. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where aligned actions strengthen inner coherence, which in turn makes future aligned actions more natural and automatic. The quality develops through conscious choices to maintain congruence, especially when facing pressure to compromise, gradually building into a stable character structure that automatically generates consistent behavior.

In practical expression, integrity manifests as reliability in relationships, clarity in decision-making, and resilience under pressure. It creates a distinctive kind of trust that others can sense and rely upon, enabling deeper cooperation and more meaningful connections. This quality becomes particularly visible during challenges or conflicts, where it enables maintained ethical stance despite personal costs, serving as a stabilizing force in human systems and relationships.

This universalized description aims to:
1. Capture the phenomenon in experiential rather than theoretical terms
2. Connect individual experience to universal patterns
3. Maintain philosophical sophistication while using accessible language
4. Preserve practical applicability
5. Enable cross-cultural understanding

The description focuses on the observable phenomenon and its functions rather than cultural-specific interpretations, while maintaining the depth and sophistication of the original business ethics concept.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this description or elaborate on specific elements?
