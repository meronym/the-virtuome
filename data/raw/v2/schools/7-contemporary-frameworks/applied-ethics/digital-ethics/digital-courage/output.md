[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive strengthening of moral conviction in technical contexts, supported by growing technical understanding and ethical clarity. It begins with recognition of ethical imperatives in technical systems, grows through small acts of standing firm on principles, and matures into capacity for significant protective action. The quality is reinforced by ethical community, clear principles, and evidence of positive impact.

In practice, this quality enables individuals to serve as crucial safeguards of human values in technological development. It manifests in actions ranging from daily ethical choices in technical work to major protective interventions in technological systems. This moral strength becomes increasingly vital as technology's influence on human life expands, serving as essential counterbalance to purely technical imperatives.
