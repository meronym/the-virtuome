Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Digital Courage:

Core principle: Moral fortitude in technological contexts
Key functions: 
- Standing up for ethical principles
- Taking justified risks
- Speaking truth to power
- Protecting human values
- Leading by example

Universal experiences it relates to:
- Facing pressure to compromise values
- Standing alone for what's right
- Risking personal comfort for greater good
- Taking responsibility in uncertain situations
- Protecting vulnerable parties

Here's my attempt at a universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Ethical fortitude in technological contexts - the capacity to stand firm for human values despite systemic pressures, take principled action despite personal risks, and maintain moral clarity amidst technical complexity. This quality enables individuals to protect human dignity and collective wellbeing when confronted with technological imperatives.

[Essential Nature]
At its heart, this quality represents the moral strength to prioritize human values over technical expedience or institutional pressure. It manifests as the capacity to recognize ethical imperatives within technical systems and act on them despite personal or professional risks. This form of courage uniquely combines moral clarity with technical understanding, enabling decisive ethical action in complex socio-technical environments.

This quality bridges individual moral conviction with collective wellbeing, transforming personal ethical insight into protective action for the broader human community. It operates at the intersection of technical expertise and moral wisdom, empowering individuals to shape technological development in alignment with human values.

[Manifestations]
- Speaking up about ethical concerns in technical systems despite institutional resistance
- Making personal sacrifices to protect collective digital rights and freedoms
- Maintaining ethical standards in development despite pressure for expedience
- Taking decisive action to prevent technological harm to vulnerable populations
- Leading initiatives for more ethical technical practices despite opposition
- Standing firm on human-centered principles in automated systems
- Protecting human agency and dignity in technological transformation

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive strengthening of moral conviction in technical contexts, supported by growing technical understanding and ethical clarity. It begins with recognition of ethical imperatives in technical systems, grows through small acts of standing firm on principles, and matures into capacity for significant protective action. The quality is reinforced by ethical community, clear principles, and evidence of positive impact.

In practice, this quality enables individuals to serve as crucial safeguards of human values in technological development. It manifests in actions ranging from daily ethical choices in technical work to major protective interventions in technological systems. This moral strength becomes increasingly vital as technology's influence on human life expands, serving as essential counterbalance to purely technical imperatives.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? Yes - focuses on universal human experiences of standing firm for values
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear manifestations and development path
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal action to collective wellbeing
5. Development clear? Yes - describes progression from recognition to action
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - concrete examples provided

The reformulation maintains the essence of Digital Courage while making it more universally accessible and practically applicable. It preserves the sophistication of the concept while grounding it in common human experience and observable manifestations.

Would you like me to:
1. Refine any particular aspect?
2. Add more practical examples?
3. Elaborate on development methods?
4. Explore relationships with other virtues?
