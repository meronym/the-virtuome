Let me follow the process systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Fair distribution of digital power, access, and opportunity
Key functions: 
- Equalizing technological access
- Preventing digital discrimination
- Ensuring algorithmic fairness
- Protecting digital rights
- Promoting inclusive participation

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Fairness/unfairness in resource distribution
- Inclusion/exclusion from important systems
- Power imbalances in communication
- Access to essential tools and knowledge
- Systemic barriers and opportunities

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Essential nature: Systemic fairness in connected systems
Observable manifestations: Access patterns, participation rates, outcome distributions
Developmental trajectory: From basic access to meaningful participation
Systemic relationships: Interacts with economic, social, and political justice

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity of connected systems to distribute power, access, and opportunity fairly among all participants, ensuring that technological advancement serves human flourishing equitably. This quality manifests in both system design and social arrangements, promoting inclusive participation while actively addressing barriers and biases.

[Essential Nature]
At its heart, this quality represents the alignment of interconnected systems with fundamental human equality. It operates at multiple levels simultaneously: ensuring basic access to essential tools and knowledge, promoting meaningful participation in digital spaces, and protecting individual and collective rights in networked environments. It actively counteracts the tendency of systems to amplify existing advantages or create new forms of exclusion.

This quality bridges individual empowerment with collective advancement, recognizing that true system fairness requires both structural design and active maintenance. It manifests as a dynamic balance between enabling individual agency and ensuring collective benefit, continuously adapting to address emerging forms of inequality or exclusion.

[Manifestations]
- Equal access to essential tools and knowledge
- Fair distribution of participation opportunities
- Protection from systematic bias and discrimination
- Active removal of barriers to meaningful engagement
- Equitable distribution of benefits and responsibilities
- Recognition and amplification of underrepresented voices
- Balanced power relationships in connected systems

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through continuous assessment and adjustment of system dynamics, identifying and addressing both obvious and subtle forms of exclusion or inequity. It works by combining proactive design principles with responsive adaptation, ensuring that technological advancement serves rather than subverts human equality. The quality develops through increasing awareness of system impacts, growing capability to detect inequities, and expanding capacity to implement effective solutions.

In practice, it manifests as deliberate choices in system design, policy formation, and resource allocation that promote inclusive participation and equitable benefit distribution. Success appears as increasing diversity of meaningful participation, more equitable outcome distributions, and the emergence of self-reinforcing patterns of inclusive growth. This creates environments where technological advancement naturally amplifies human potential across all segments of society.

This universalized description:
1. Maintains the core ethical principles while removing culture-specific references
2. Connects to universal human experiences of fairness and participation
3. Addresses both individual and systemic aspects
4. Provides clear indicators for practical implementation
5. Preserves the sophistication of the original concept
6. Makes the developmental trajectory clear

The description passes the verification questions by:
1. Using universal human experiences as reference points
2. Maintaining the structural and ethical complexity
3. Providing clear practical manifestations
4. Connecting individual to collective aspects
5. Outlining clear development patterns
6. Offering observable indicators of presence/absence

Would you like me to:
1. Further develop any particular aspect?
2. Provide more concrete examples?
3. Elaborate on the developmental trajectory?
4. Explore relationships with other virtues?
