Let me follow the process systematically:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Digital Wisdom:
- Core principle: Integration of human judgment with technological understanding
- Key functions: Discernment, foresight, balanced evaluation
- Systemic role: Meta-virtue guiding technological engagement
- Developmental aspects: Progressive deepening of understanding and judgment

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences it relates to:
- Making complex decisions with incomplete information
- Balancing innovation with preservation
- Navigating tool-mediated environments
- Integrating new capabilities with existing wisdom

Here's my attempt at a universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to discern true benefit and harm in tool-mediated environments, integrating timeless wisdom with understanding of new possibilities. It manifests as clear judgment about how to use capabilities and systems in ways that genuinely serve human flourishing while avoiding both fearful rejection and uncritical embrace.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the marriage of depth and adaptability in human judgment. It emerges from the intersection of accumulated wisdom about human nature and flourishing with clear understanding of new possibilities and challenges. Unlike mere technical knowledge or traditional wisdom alone, it enables navigation of novel situations through recognition of underlying patterns while appreciating genuine uniqueness.

At its core, it embodies the human capacity to maintain clear discernment even as contexts evolve, recognizing both eternal principles and emerging realities. It preserves human agency and wisdom while engaging new capabilities, neither surrendering judgment to systems nor rejecting their genuine benefits.

[Manifestations]
- Balanced evaluation that neither over-relies on nor dismisses new capabilities
- Clear recognition of when to employ or refrain from using available tools
- Ability to distinguish between genuine advancement and mere novelty
- Integration of multiple perspectives and timeframes in decision-making
- Recognition of patterns across different contexts and scales
- Maintenance of human agency while leveraging enhanced capabilities
- Discernment of deeper implications beyond immediate effects

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through iterative engagement with both timeless principles and novel situations. It begins with foundation in basic wisdom about human nature and flourishing, then progressively incorporates understanding of new possibilities through direct experience and reflection. Critical moments of choice and their consequences serve as essential teachers, gradually building pattern recognition that transcends specific contexts.

In practice, it operates as a meta-level guidance system, informing both strategic decisions and daily choices about tool engagement. It enables recognition of genuine opportunities for enhancement while maintaining awareness of human essentials that must be preserved. This quality constantly evolves through challenge and reflection, developing greater subtlety in discernment while maintaining connection to fundamental wisdom about human flourishing.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? Yes - focuses on universal human experiences of tool use and judgment
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible
3. Practically applicable? Yes - provides clear markers for development and application
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal judgment to universal patterns
5. Development clarity? Yes - describes progressive refinement through experience
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - lists concrete expressions and behaviors

The description maintains the sophistication of digital wisdom while making it accessible beyond purely digital contexts. It connects to the universal human experience of navigating tool-mediated environments while preserving essential judgment and agency.

Would you like me to:
1. Refine any particular aspect?
2. Add more specific examples?
3. Elaborate on the developmental process?
4. Strengthen any of the verification criteria?
