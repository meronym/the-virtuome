[Core Definition]
The quality of mindful guardianship over information and digital resources, expressed through responsible collection, protection, use, and sharing of data. It combines careful stewardship with ethical judgment, ensuring that information serves human flourishing while respecting individual rights and collective well-being.

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous process of mindful attention and ethical judgment. It begins with recognition of the value and sensitivity of information, develops through practical skills of protection and management, and matures into wisdom about appropriate use and sharing. The steward learns to navigate complex trade-offs between accessibility and security, immediate utility and long-term preservation, individual privacy and collective benefit.

In practice, it manifests as careful daily habits combined with strategic vision. The steward develops refined judgment about appropriate collection, strong systems for protection, clear protocols for use, and ethical frameworks for sharing. This creates an environment where information serves its proper purpose while rights are protected, trust is maintained, and sustainable practices ensure long-term preservation of value.
