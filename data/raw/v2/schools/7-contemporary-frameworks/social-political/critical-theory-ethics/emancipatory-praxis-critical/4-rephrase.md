Let me follow the process systematically for Emancipatory Praxis.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Integration of reflection and action for liberation
Key functions: 
- Conscious transformation of reality
- Integration of thought and action
- Social-personal development unity
- Cyclical learning-action process

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Learning through doing
- Personal-social growth
- Conscious change-making
- Reflective action
- Purposeful development

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to consciously transform one's reality through an integrated cycle of reflection and action, where understanding deepens through engagement and action becomes more effective through understanding. This fundamental human quality enables purposeful personal and collective development through conscious, intentional practice.

[Essential Nature]
Conscious transformative practice represents the human capacity to learn and grow through intentional action, combining deep understanding with practical engagement. It manifests as a dynamic spiral where reflection informs action and action deepens reflection, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of development. This quality bridges the gap between knowing and doing, between understanding what needs to change and actively participating in that change.

Unlike passive understanding or blind action, this quality represents the integration of wisdom and practice in a way that transforms both the practitioner and their environment. It operates at both personal and collective levels, enabling genuine development through the unity of thought and action.

[Manifestations]
- Reflecting on experience to extract deeper understanding
- Taking action informed by clear understanding
- Learning actively through engaged practice
- Adjusting approach based on practical results
- Developing self and environment simultaneously
- Building capacity through intentional practice
- Creating positive change through conscious action

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through deliberate engagement with meaningful challenges, where one must both understand deeply and act effectively. It begins with simple cycles of reflection and action, gradually building into more sophisticated practice as understanding deepens and capability grows. The process requires both courage to act and wisdom to reflect, creating a dynamic balance between doing and understanding.

In practice, this quality enables increasingly effective engagement with life's challenges through continuous learning and development. It manifests in everything from personal skill development to collective social change, always involving the conscious integration of understanding and action. The result is genuine transformation that affects both the practitioner and their environment, creating sustainable positive change through conscious engagement.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: Yes - based on universal human experiences of learning and development
2. Depth preservation: Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear connection to concrete action and development
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - links personal practice to broader transformation
5. Development clarity: Yes - describes progression from simple to complex practice
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - listed behaviors and outcomes are verifiable

The description maintains the transformative essence of the original Critical Theory concept while making it accessible and applicable across contexts. It preserves the sophisticated understanding of how conscious practice leads to development while expressing it in universal human terms.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this description further?
