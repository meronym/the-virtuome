Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: The fundamental capacity to acknowledge and validate human dignity
Key functions: 
- Enabling authentic human connection
- Supporting identity development
- Facilitating social justice
- Building mutual understanding

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Desire to be seen/acknowledged
- Need for validation
- Experience of dignity/disrespect
- Mutual understanding across differences

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary patterns:
- Individual recognition → collective acknowledgment
- Personal dignity → social respect
- Identity validation → structural justice

Now, creating the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to deeply acknowledge and affirm the inherent dignity and authentic reality of others, while understanding how recognition shapes both individual development and social structures. This fundamental human ability enables genuine connection across differences and supports both personal growth and collective flourishing.

[Essential Nature]
Recognition represents a foundational human capacity operating at multiple levels simultaneously: perceptual, emotional, and social. It begins with the ability to truly see others in their full humanity, extending beyond mere awareness to active acknowledgment of their unique reality, experiences, and worth. This quality combines deep attention with affirmative presence, creating spaces where authentic being and becoming can emerge.

At its core, recognition involves a dynamic interplay between acknowledging others' current reality while simultaneously holding space for their potential. It requires balancing respect for what is with openness to what could be, maintaining tension between acceptance and transformation.

[Manifestations]
- Deep listening that conveys understanding and validation
- Genuine curiosity about others' experiences and perspectives
- Active affirmation of others' dignity through word and deed
- Creating spaces where others feel safe to be authentic
- Building relationships that support mutual growth
- Challenging structures that deny recognition to any group
- Fostering environments where diverse identities can flourish

[Functional Description]
Recognition operates through a sophisticated interplay of perception, empathy, and ethical awareness. It begins with heightened attention to others' presence and experience, develops through emotional resonance and understanding, and matures into active practices of acknowledgment and validation. This capacity grows through conscious practice, challenged assumptions, and expanded awareness of human dignity's many dimensions.

In practice, recognition manifests as a dynamic balance of receptivity and response. It shows up in how we listen, speak, and act in ways that validate others' reality while supporting their development. This quality transforms relationships by creating conditions for authentic expression and mutual understanding, while simultaneously working to address systemic barriers to recognition at broader social levels.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? Yes - builds on universal human experiences of dignity and acknowledgment
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible
3. Practically applicable? Yes - includes concrete manifestations and practical guidance
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal capacity to collective implications
5. Development clear? Yes - describes growth process and conditions
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - lists concrete behaviors and practices

This universalized description maintains the sophisticated ethical framework of Critical Theory while making it accessible through universal human experiences and practical manifestations. It preserves the transformative potential while grounding it in observable reality.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect or proceed with universalizing another virtue from the list?
