Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to envision and work toward profound positive change while fully acknowledging current difficulties, maintaining creative tension between present reality and future possibility. This quality enables constructive action in challenging circumstances through the integration of clear-seeing and life-affirming vision.

[Essential Nature]
Radical hope represents a distinct form of human capability that transcends both ordinary optimism and wishful thinking. It combines unflinching awareness of current conditions with deep commitment to positive possibility, creating a dynamic foundation for transformative action. Unlike simple positivity, it grows stronger through engaging with difficulty, transforming challenges into opportunities for deeper understanding and more effective action.

This quality operates at both individual and collective levels, enabling people to maintain constructive engagement with significant challenges while nurturing visions of meaningful change. It provides psychological and practical resources for sustained effort toward important goals, especially when facing complex or seemingly intractable problems.

[Manifestations]
- Maintaining constructive engagement despite setbacks or obstacles
- Creating new solutions and possibilities in challenging situations
- Supporting others in difficult circumstances while acknowledging reality
- Building long-term vision while addressing immediate needs
- Converting apparent dead-ends into opportunities for new approaches
- Sustaining collective effort toward shared goals despite difficulties
- Discovering hidden possibilities within apparent limitations

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the intentional practice of holding creative tension between clear perception of current reality and compelling vision of positive possibility. It grows stronger through engaging with real challenges while maintaining connection to deeper purpose and possibility. The capacity is reinforced through community support, shared vision, and the experience of creating positive change despite difficulties.

In practical application, radical hope enables sustained constructive action in challenging circumstances by providing both psychological resources and practical strategies. It manifests as the ability to maintain effective engagement with difficult situations while nurturing viable paths toward positive change. This quality supports both individual resilience and collective transformation by connecting immediate actions to larger purpose and possibility.
