Now, the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to experience, process, and channel the energy of anger in ways that protect dignity, correct injustice, and create positive change, while maintaining personal wholeness and fostering collective healing. This quality transforms potentially destructive emotional force into constructive power for personal and social transformation.

[Essential Nature]
Constructive anger operates as a sophisticated human capacity that integrates emotional intelligence, moral clarity, and transformative action. It begins with the recognition of legitimate grievance or boundary violation, develops through conscious processing and understanding, and manifests as directed energy for positive change. Unlike suppressed or uncontrolled anger, this quality maintains a dynamic balance between emotional honesty and strategic effectiveness, between personal truth and collective good.

This quality serves as both protective mechanism and creative force, combining the wisdom to recognize what must not be accepted with the vision to create what should exist instead. It transforms raw emotional energy into focused power for change while preserving connection and fostering healing.

[Manifestations]
- Clear recognition and articulation of legitimate grievances
- Balanced emotional expression that neither suppresses nor overwhelms
- Strategic channeling of emotional energy into effective action
- Maintenance of dignity and connection while addressing wrongs
- Creation of protective boundaries while keeping heart open
- Transformation of personal pain into collective power
- Development of sustainable practices for long-term change

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a process of emotional maturation, ethical awareness, and practical wisdom. It begins with the capacity to fully feel and acknowledge anger, progresses through understanding its messages and meanings, and culminates in the ability to channel its energy effectively. The development involves learning to distinguish between reactive and responsive anger, between destructive and constructive expression, and between personal and systemic causes.

In practice, this quality enables individuals and groups to maintain moral clarity while taking effective action, to protect boundaries while building bridges, and to challenge injustice while creating alternatives. It supports sustainable activism by preventing burnout, maintains community through conflict, and transforms grievances into positive change. This capacity is essential for both personal empowerment and social transformation, operating at the intersection of emotional intelligence and social justice.
