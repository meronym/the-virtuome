Let me follow the process systematically:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Mutual support and care extended beyond individual relationships
Key functions: Sustaining communities, distributing care responsibility, preventing burnout
Systemic role: Creating resilient support networks, maintaining social fabric
Developmental aspects: From individual to collective awareness, building care infrastructure

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Community support during hardship
- Shared responsibility for wellbeing
- Mutual aid networks
- Collective response to challenges

Timeless patterns:
- Reciprocal care arrangements
- Community resilience mechanisms
- Sustainable support systems
- Distributed responsibility

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to create, maintain, and participate in networks of mutual support that distribute care responsibilities across communities, ensuring collective wellbeing through shared responsibility and reciprocal attention to needs, while building sustainable systems of support that transcend individual relationships.

[Essential Nature]
Collective care emerges from the recognition that human wellbeing is inherently interconnected and that sustainable support requires coordinated effort beyond individual relationships. It manifests as both an awareness of shared responsibility and the practical creation of care infrastructure. This quality operates at the intersection of personal capability and social organization, transforming individual acts of care into sustainable patterns of mutual support.

Unlike simple helping behaviors, collective care involves the conscious development of systems and practices that distribute care responsibilities across networks of relationships, preventing burnout while ensuring more reliable and comprehensive support for all members of a community.

[Manifestations]
- Creation and maintenance of mutual support networks
- Development of sustainable care practices and routines
- Distribution of care responsibilities across community members
- Establishment of reciprocal support arrangements
- Recognition and response to patterns of collective need
- Building of care infrastructure and support systems
- Integration of individual and community wellbeing practices

[Functional Description]
Collective care operates through the intentional development of support networks and care practices that extend beyond immediate relationships. It involves identifying community needs, organizing resources and capabilities, and creating sustainable systems for mutual support. This quality develops through growing awareness of interdependence, practical experience in care coordination, and the cultivation of trust networks that can sustain long-term mutual support.

In practice, collective care manifests as organized systems of mutual aid, shared responsibility for community wellbeing, and coordinated responses to individual and collective challenges. It creates resilient support networks that can respond to varying needs while preventing caregiver burnout through the distribution of responsibilities. This approach transforms individual acts of care into sustainable patterns of community support, building lasting infrastructure for collective wellbeing.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Yes - mutual support and collective responsibility are universal human experiences
2. Preserves depth: Yes - maintains sophistication while making concept accessible
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear pathways for implementation
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - links personal capacity to collective systems
5. Developmental clarity: Yes - shows progression from individual to systematic care
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - concrete expressions and practices listed

The description maintains the feminist ethics origins while making the concept accessible and applicable across cultural contexts. It preserves the sophisticated understanding of care infrastructure while grounding it in universal human experiences of mutual support and community resilience.
