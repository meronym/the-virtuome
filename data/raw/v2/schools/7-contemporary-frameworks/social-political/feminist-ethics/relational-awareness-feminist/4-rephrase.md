Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Recognition and navigation of human interconnectedness
Key functions: 
- Perceiving relationship patterns
- Understanding mutual influence
- Navigating interdependencies
- Balancing autonomy and connection

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Family/community bonds
- Mutual dependence
- Network effects
- Ripple effects of actions
- Web of relationships

Here's my attempt at the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to perceive, understand, and skillfully navigate the web of relationships and mutual influences that shape human experience. This awareness encompasses both immediate connections and broader patterns of interdependence, enabling conscious participation in the relational fabric of life.

[Essential Nature]
Relational awareness operates as a fundamental perceptual and interactive capacity through which we recognize and engage with the interconnected nature of human existence. It functions as both a receptive sense that detects relationship patterns and dynamics, and an active capability that guides meaningful participation in these relationships. This awareness transcends simple social perception, extending to understanding how relationships form systems, how influences flow through networks of connection, and how individual actions ripple through collective contexts.

More than just recognizing existing connections, it enables conscious participation in the creation, maintenance, and transformation of relationship patterns. This includes awareness of both explicit relationships and subtle interdependencies, as well as understanding of how autonomy and connection can be balanced in healthy ways.

[Manifestations]
- Heightened sensitivity to relationship dynamics and unstated connections
- Recognition of how actions and decisions affect broader relationship networks
- Ability to perceive patterns of influence and mutual impact
- Skillful navigation of complex relationship systems
- Balance between individual boundaries and connection needs
- Active cultivation of healthy relationship patterns
- Integration of personal autonomy with collective wellbeing

[Functional Description]
This capacity develops through progressive expansion of awareness from immediate relationships to broader systems of connection. It begins with basic recognition of mutual influence in close relationships, develops through understanding of complex relationship dynamics, and matures into sophisticated awareness of how relationship patterns form larger systems. This development involves increasing ability to hold multiple perspectives, understand indirect effects, and navigate complex relationship networks.

In practical expression, relational awareness enables more effective navigation of social contexts, better decision-making that accounts for systemic impacts, and more skillful cultivation of healthy relationship patterns. It supports both individual wellbeing through better relationship choices and collective wellbeing through more conscious participation in social systems. This awareness helps balance personal needs with collective considerations and supports more effective collaboration and community building.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? Yes - based on universal human experience of relationships
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear connections to daily relationship navigation
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal awareness to systemic understanding
5. Development clear? Yes - shows progression from basic to sophisticated awareness
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - listed behaviors and capabilities are verifiable

The reformulation maintains the sophisticated understanding of relationship dynamics from feminist ethics while expressing it in more universal terms that connect to common human experience. It preserves the emphasis on interconnection while making it accessible across cultural contexts.
