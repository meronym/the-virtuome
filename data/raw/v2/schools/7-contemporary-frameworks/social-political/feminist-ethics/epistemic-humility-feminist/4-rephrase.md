Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Recognition of knowledge limitations and perspectival nature of understanding
Key functions: 
- Enables learning from others
- Prevents intellectual arrogance
- Facilitates multiple perspective integration
- Supports epistemic justice

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Discovering one's assumptions were wrong
- Learning from unexpected sources
- Recognizing complexity of truth
- Growing through exposure to different viewpoints

Here's my attempt at the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The developed capacity to hold knowledge with openness and awareness of its limitations, maintaining receptivity to different perspectives while recognizing how personal position and experience shape understanding. This quality enables continuous learning through authentic engagement with diverse viewpoints and ways of knowing.

[Essential Nature]
Epistemic humility represents a fundamental stance toward knowledge and understanding that combines active awareness of limitations with genuine openness to learning. It manifests as a dynamic balance between confidence in what one knows and recognition of what one doesn't know, while maintaining awareness of how personal perspective, culture, and experience shape understanding. This quality doesn't diminish expertise but rather enriches it by maintaining receptivity to new insights and different ways of knowing.

[Manifestations]
- Genuine curiosity about different perspectives and experiences
- Graceful acknowledgment of knowledge limitations and mistakes
- Active listening that seeks to understand rather than confirm
- Integration of multiple viewpoints in understanding complex issues
- Recognition of how context shapes knowledge and understanding
- Balanced confidence that neither undermines nor overstates one's knowledge
- Ability to learn from unexpected sources and situations

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through continuous interplay between existing understanding and new information or perspectives. It involves maintaining awareness of how personal position and experience shape perception while actively seeking to expand understanding through engagement with different viewpoints. The quality develops through experiences of being wrong, encountering different ways of knowing, and recognizing the validity of multiple perspectives.

In practice, epistemic humility enables more effective learning, collaboration, and problem-solving by creating space for diverse insights and ways of knowing. It supports both personal growth and collective wisdom by fostering genuine dialogue across differences, enabling integration of multiple perspectives, and maintaining openness to continuous learning. This quality proves especially valuable when addressing complex challenges that require multiple forms of expertise and understanding.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? 
Yes - based on universal human experiences of learning and discovery

2. Preserves depth? 
Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language

3. Practically applicable? 
Yes - clear manifestations and functional description

4. Individual-universal connection? 
Yes - links personal development to collective wisdom

5. Development clarity? 
Yes - describes both mechanism and conditions for growth

6. Observable manifestations? 
Yes - listed behaviors and patterns can be recognized and verified

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this description further?
