Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Ethical stewardship of influence and capability
Functions: Empowerment, guidance, facilitation, protection
Systemic role: Distribution and cultivation of collective capability
Developmental aspects: From personal to collective empowerment

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Leading/guiding others
- Having influence over outcomes
- Nurturing others' growth
- Managing resources/capabilities
- Balancing individual/collective needs

STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Capacity to use influence ethically
- Awareness of impact
- Development of others
- Systemic awareness

Secondary:
- Power dynamics awareness
- Resource stewardship
- Collective empowerment
- Sustainable influence

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to consciously and ethically exercise influence in ways that nurture collective flourishing, characterized by the skillful balance of personal capability with responsibility to others, while actively developing and distributing power rather than accumulating or hoarding it.

[Essential Nature]
Responsible Power emerges from the recognition that human capability and influence are not merely personal assets but relational resources that can either nurture or diminish collective wellbeing. It manifests as a dynamic balance between effective action and ethical awareness, combining the confidence to exercise influence with the wisdom to do so in service of shared flourishing. This quality transforms traditional power dynamics from domination or control into collaborative empowerment, where influence becomes a tool for developing capability in others and nurturing systemic health.

[Manifestations]
- Clear, confident decision-making that considers multiple stakeholder impacts
- Active development of capability and autonomy in others
- Skillful navigation of power dynamics with ethical awareness
- Creation of structures and processes that distribute rather than concentrate power
- Balanced integration of personal authority with genuine accountability
- Demonstration of impact through collective achievement rather than personal dominance
- Consistent pattern of leaving systems and people stronger after engagement

[Functional Description]
Responsible Power operates through a continuous cycle of awareness, action, and adjustment. It begins with deep recognition of one's sphere of influence and its systemic implications, develops through conscious practice of ethical decision-making, and matures into an integrated capacity for empowering leadership. This quality grows through actively seeking feedback, embracing accountability, and consistently choosing collective benefit over personal advantage.

In practice, it manifests as leadership that naturally cultivates more leaders, decision-making that strengthens rather than depletes systemic resources, and influence that generates expanding circles of capability. Success is measured not by personal accumulation of power but by the growing capacity of the collective system and its members to thrive independently.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Yes - focuses on universal dynamics of influence and responsibility
2. Preservation of depth: Yes - maintains sophistication while increasing accessibility
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear behavioral manifestations and development path
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - links personal capability to collective wellbeing
5. Development clarity: Yes - shows progression from awareness to integrated capacity
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - concrete behavioral indicators provided

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
