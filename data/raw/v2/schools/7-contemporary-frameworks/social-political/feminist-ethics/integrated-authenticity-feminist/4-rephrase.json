DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS\n- Emphasis on relationships and interdependence\n- Integration of emotion and reason\n- Focus on concrete contexts over abstract principles\n- Recognition of power dynamics\n- Valuing marginalized perspectives\n\n3.

INTEGRATED AUTHENTICITY\n- Wholeness of self including emotion, reason, body\n- Resistance to imposed definitions/limitations\n- Personal truth in social context\n\n5. CONSTRUCTIVE ANGER\n- Righteous anger as moral compass\n- Catalyst for social change\n- Transform rather than suppress/explode\n\n6. RESPONSIBLE POWER\n- Ethical use of influence and capability\n- Power-with rather than power-over\n- Includes mentorship and empowerment of others\n\n7. EPISTEMIC HUMILITY\n- Recognition of situated knowledge\n- Openness to multiple perspectives\n- Particularly from marginalized positions\n\n8.
