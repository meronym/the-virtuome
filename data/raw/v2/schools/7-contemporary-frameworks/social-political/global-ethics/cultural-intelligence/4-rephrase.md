Let me follow the structured approach to universalize Cultural Intelligence.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Ability to navigate human diversity effectively
Key functions: Understanding, bridging, adapting, learning
Primary patterns: Observation → Understanding → Adaptation → Integration
Developmental: Awareness → Knowledge → Skill → Wisdom

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Encountering difference
- Navigating unfamiliarity
- Learning new social contexts
- Building bridges between worldviews

STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Perceptual awareness of diversity
- Pattern recognition across differences
- Adaptive response capability
- Integration of multiple perspectives

Secondary:
- Emotional intelligence in unfamiliar contexts
- Suspension of judgment
- Comfort with ambiguity
- Bridge-building capacity

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to perceive, understand, and effectively navigate human differences while maintaining both receptivity to new patterns of meaning and stability in one's own center. It enables authentic connection across varying ways of being, thinking, and relating, while fostering mutual growth through difference.

[Essential Nature]
Cultural Intelligence emerges from the fundamental human ability to learn from difference and adapt to new social contexts. It combines keen observation, suspended judgment, and flexible response patterns with a stable core of self-awareness. This quality develops through progressive exposure to diversity, coupled with reflective integration of new perspectives and patterns of meaning.

Unlike static knowledge or mere tolerance, it represents a dynamic capacity that grows through engagement with difference. At its mature level, it transforms from a conscious competence into an intuitive wisdom that can bridge worlds while enriching all parties involved.

[Manifestations]
- Maintaining grounded presence when encountering unfamiliar patterns of behavior or meaning
- Detecting subtle cues and implicit meanings in novel social contexts
- Adapting communication and behavior while maintaining authenticity
- Building genuine connections across apparent differences
- Finding creative solutions that honor multiple perspectives
- Facilitating mutual understanding between different viewpoints
- Supporting others in navigating unfamiliar contexts

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous cycle of observation, reflection, and adaptation. It begins with heightened awareness of both self and other, moves through careful perception of patterns and meanings, and culminates in skillful navigation of differences. The process is supported by underlying capacities for suspending judgment, tolerating ambiguity, and maintaining emotional equilibrium in unfamiliar situations.

In practice, it enables individuals to move fluidly between different social contexts while maintaining authentic presence and fostering genuine connection. This creates bridges of understanding that expand both individual and collective capacity for handling complexity. The quality grows stronger through active engagement with diversity, reflection on experience, and integration of new patterns into one's worldview.

This universalized description:
- Focuses on the underlying human capacity rather than cultural specifics
- Emphasizes observable phenomena and experiences
- Maintains sophistication while using accessible language
- Links individual development to universal human patterns
- Provides clear markers for practical application
- Preserves the depth of the original concept while making it universally accessible

The description passes the verification questions by:
1. Using phenomenological rather than culture-specific language
2. Maintaining the sophisticated understanding of the original concept
3. Providing clear practical applications
4. Linking individual experience to universal patterns
5. Outlining clear developmental progression
6. Focusing on observable manifestations

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
