Let me follow the process systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Shared accountability for collective outcomes
Key functions: 
- Coordinates group action
- Distributes responsibility
- Enables large-scale cooperation
- Maintains commons
- Addresses collective challenges

Relationship patterns:
- Individual-group dynamics
- Local-global interactions
- Cross-scale coordination
- Network effects

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Group cooperation needs
- Shared resource management
- Common threat response
- Community maintenance
- Mutual interdependence

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Core function: Enables coordinated action for shared challenges
Development path: Personal awareness → Group participation → Systemic engagement
Key relationships: Individual-collective, Local-global, Present-future

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, accept, and actively participate in shared accountability for collective outcomes, combining personal agency with group coordination to address common challenges and maintain shared resources. This quality enables effective collective action while honoring both individual contribution and systemic interdependence.

[Essential Nature]
Collective responsibility emerges from the fundamental reality of human interdependence and our shared stake in common outcomes. It manifests as an active awareness of how individual actions contribute to collective results, coupled with the practical capability to coordinate efforts effectively with others. This quality bridges the gap between personal agency and group needs, enabling coherent action at scales beyond individual capacity.

Unlike simple cooperation or rule-following, collective responsibility involves deep recognition of shared stakes and outcomes, proactive engagement with group needs, and the ability to maintain commitment to common goods even when immediate personal benefit isn't evident. It operates through the integration of awareness, capability, and practical engagement.

[Manifestations]
- Recognition of shared stakes in outcomes
- Active participation in group problem-solving
- Maintenance of common resources
- Balancing individual and collective needs
- Coordinated response to shared challenges
- Long-term commitment to collective wellbeing
- Integration of diverse perspectives and capabilities

[Functional Description]
Collective responsibility operates through three interconnected mechanisms: awareness of interdependence, capability for coordinated action, and commitment to shared outcomes. It begins with recognition of how individual actions affect collective results, develops through practical experience in group coordination, and matures into skilled navigation of complex collective challenges. This quality enables individuals to effectively participate in larger-scale actions while maintaining personal agency and authentic engagement.

In practice, collective responsibility manifests as active participation in addressing shared challenges, maintaining common resources, and building sustainable solutions to collective problems. It enables groups to respond coherently to complex challenges while preserving individual initiative and creativity. This quality proves essential for addressing challenges that exceed individual capacity, from local community maintenance to global environmental stewardship.

Verification Check:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: ✓ (Based on universal human experiences of group coordination)
2. Preservation of depth: ✓ (Maintains sophistication while using accessible language)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (Clear manifestations and functional description)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (Links personal agency to collective outcomes)
5. Development clarity: ✓ (Shows progression from awareness to skilled engagement)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (Listed concrete, verifiable expressions)

The description avoids culture-specific references while maintaining the depth and practical relevance of the concept. It uses phenomenological language focused on human experience rather than theoretical constructs, making it accessible across contexts while preserving philosophical sophistication.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universal description?
