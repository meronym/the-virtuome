Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Restorative Praxis:
- Core principle: Active healing work that combines understanding with practice
- Key functions: Restoration, transformation, healing, rebuilding
- Systemic role: Bridges personal/collective healing with structural change
- Developmental aspects: Moves from awareness to action to transformation

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
- Universal experiences: Recovery from harm, rebuilding, healing relationships
- Parallel concepts: Rehabilitation, reconciliation, restoration, renewal
- Contemporary relevance: Trauma healing, community building, conflict resolution
- Timeless patterns: Cycle of harm-healing-transformation

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to actively heal and transform damage while building new, healthy patterns of being. It combines deep understanding of harm's impact with practical skills for restoration, operating simultaneously at personal and collective levels to create conditions for genuine renewal and growth.

[Essential Nature]
Restorative capacity manifests as an active force that works to heal damage while simultaneously creating new, life-affirming patterns and structures. It operates through the recognition that genuine healing requires both addressing past harm and building new foundations for health and wholeness. This quality combines keen awareness of what has been broken with practical wisdom about how to repair and rebuild, always working toward greater wholeness rather than mere return to previous states.

[Manifestations]
- Ability to identify and acknowledge harm without being overwhelmed by it
- Practical skill in facilitating healing processes
- Capacity to hold space for both pain and possibility
- Intelligence in rebuilding relationships and systems
- Balance between addressing past wounds and creating future wellness
- Integration of understanding with practical action
- Development of sustainable, healthy patterns

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive integration of awareness and action. It begins with recognition of harm and its impacts, develops through learning practical healing skills, and matures into the capacity to guide transformative processes. Each stage of development enhances both understanding of damage patterns and ability to facilitate healing, leading to increasingly sophisticated restoration work.

In practice, this quality enables individuals and groups to move through healing processes while building new strengths. It manifests as the ability to create safe spaces for healing work, facilitate difficult conversations, guide practical rebuilding efforts, and maintain focus on long-term transformation. The work operates simultaneously at personal, interpersonal, and structural levels, recognizing their interconnection in both damage and healing.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: ✓ Uses universal human experiences of harm and healing
2. Preservation of depth: ✓ Maintains sophisticated understanding of transformation
3. Practical applicability: ✓ Clear connection to concrete actions and processes
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ Links personal healing to collective transformation
5. Developmental clarity: ✓ Shows progression from awareness to skilled action
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ Listed behaviors and capacities are verifiable

The description maintains the sophistication of postcolonial thought while making it accessible through universal human experiences of harm, healing, and transformation. It preserves the active, practical nature of praxis while speaking to universal human capacities for restoration and renewal.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
