Let me follow the analytical process and then create the universal language description.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Mutual supportive connection and coordinated action between groups
Key functions: 
- Building resilient support networks
- Enabling collective resistance
- Sharing resources and knowledge
- Creating unified strength while preserving diversity

Relationship patterns:
- Horizontal rather than hierarchical
- Reciprocal rather than charitable
- Strategic while maintaining authenticity
- Both practical and emotional dimensions

Developmental aspects:
- From recognition to understanding
- From understanding to action
- From isolated to networked resistance
- From temporary alliance to sustained connection

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Recognition of shared challenges
- Mutual aid in difficult times
- Strength through unity
- Collective problem-solving

Parallel concepts:
- Community mutual support
- Social cohesion
- Collective resilience
- Network strength

Contemporary relevance:
- Global challenges requiring coordination
- Complex problems needing collective solutions
- Increasing interconnection of social issues
- Need for sustainable support systems

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize shared challenges and create sustained networks of mutual support and coordinated action, building collective strength while honoring diversity. It manifests as both practical cooperation and deep recognition of interconnected wellbeing, enabling groups to face challenges through unified response while maintaining distinctive identities.

[Essential Nature]
This quality emerges from the recognition that human challenges and aspirations often transcend individual or group boundaries, requiring coordinated response for effective address. It represents the evolution from isolated struggle to networked resilience, combining practical resource-sharing with deeper recognition of shared destiny. The quality manifests through both immediate mutual aid and long-term strategic collaboration, creating durable support systems that strengthen all participants while preserving their autonomy and unique characteristics.

[Manifestations]
- Recognition and response to others' needs without external prompting
- Creation and maintenance of resource-sharing networks
- Coordinated action in face of shared challenges
- Active support of others' wellbeing and development
- Building of lasting collaborative relationships
- Integration of diverse approaches and perspectives
- Development of sustainable support systems

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through progressive expansion of concern and capability, moving from recognition of shared challenges to active creation of support networks. It develops through practical experiences of mutual aid, growing from immediate response to sustained collaboration. The process builds both practical skills in coordination and deeper understanding of interconnected wellbeing.

In practice, it enables groups to face challenges that exceed individual capacity, creating resilient networks that enhance collective capability while preserving individual strength. These networks become self-reinforcing systems that generate both practical solutions and new forms of collaboration, leading to increased collective resilience and capability for addressing complex challenges.
```

This universal language version aims to:
- Preserve the political power of the original concept while making it accessible across contexts
- Maintain focus on practical action while including deeper understanding
- Connect immediate mutual aid with long-term strategic collaboration
- Emphasize both practical and relational aspects
- Show clear developmental trajectory
- Link individual/group/universal dimensions

The description should be meaningful across cultures while maintaining the concept's transformative potential. It connects to universal human experiences of mutual support while preserving the strategic and systematic nature of the original postcolonial virtue.

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universalization?
