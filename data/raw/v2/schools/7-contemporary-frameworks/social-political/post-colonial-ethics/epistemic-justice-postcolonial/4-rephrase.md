Let me follow the structured process to universalize the concept of Epistemic Justice.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Fair recognition and validation of different ways of knowing and understanding reality
Key functions:
- Validates diverse knowledge systems
- Challenges knowledge hierarchies
- Enables broader understanding
- Facilitates cross-cultural learning
- Promotes knowledge democracy

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Learning from elders/tradition
- Discovering alternative perspectives
- Experiencing invalidation of personal knowledge
- Recognizing wisdom in unexpected places
- Integrating different ways of understanding

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Recognition of multiple valid ways of knowing
- Active validation of marginalized knowledge
- Integration of different knowledge systems
- Fair evaluation of truth claims

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, honor, and integrate different ways of knowing and understanding reality, while ensuring fair access to knowledge-making processes. It combines receptivity to diverse forms of wisdom with active support for marginalized knowledge systems and their bearers.

[Essential Nature]
At its core, this quality reflects the human capacity to appreciate that truth and understanding can emerge through multiple pathways. It manifests as both an intellectual openness to different ways of knowing and an ethical commitment to fairness in how knowledge is validated and shared. This quality enables us to recognize that understanding can come through direct experience, inherited wisdom, systematic study, intuitive insight, practical application, or collective learning.

This quality operates at the intersection of humility and discernment â€“ humility to recognize the limitations of any single way of knowing, and discernment to evaluate knowledge claims fairly while respecting their contexts and origins.

[Manifestations]
- Active listening to and learning from those with different ways of understanding
- Recognizing valuable knowledge in unexpected places or unfamiliar forms
- Supporting and amplifying marginalized voices and wisdom traditions
- Challenging assumptions about what constitutes valid knowledge
- Integrating multiple perspectives to build richer understanding
- Creating spaces where different kinds of knowledge can be shared
- Practicing fairness in knowledge validation and transmission

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the interplay of experience and reflection, as we encounter different ways of knowing and recognize their validity through practical results or deeper insight. It begins with openness to alternative perspectives, grows through active engagement with diverse knowledge systems, and matures into the capacity to facilitate dialogue between different ways of understanding. The development of this quality requires both intellectual flexibility and ethical commitment.

In practice, this quality enables more comprehensive understanding of complex realities while ensuring fairer participation in knowledge-creation processes. It leads to richer problem-solving through the integration of multiple perspectives, more effective cross-cultural collaboration, and the preservation and evolution of diverse wisdom traditions. This creates conditions for both individual and collective learning that transcends traditional boundaries while respecting their origins and value.
```

This universalized description aims to:
- Preserve the core insights about knowledge diversity and fairness
- Make the concept accessible without specialized terminology
- Maintain practical relevance across contexts
- Connect individual practice to collective benefit
- Highlight both receptive and active aspects
- Enable application in various settings

The description emphasizes universal human experiences of knowing and learning while maintaining the ethical dimension of justice and fairness. It connects personal practice (openness to different ways of knowing) with broader social impact (fairer knowledge systems and richer collective understanding).

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universalization?
