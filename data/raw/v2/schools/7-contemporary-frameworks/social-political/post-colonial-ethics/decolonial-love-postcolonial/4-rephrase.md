Let me follow the analytical process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Decolonial Love:
Core principle: Transformative love that heals and liberates from oppressive patterns
Key functions: Healing, resistance, connection, transformation
Systemic roles: Personal healing → collective healing → social transformation
Developmental aspects: From self-recognition → self-love → collective love → transformative action

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS:
Universal experiences:
- Recovery from deeply embedded negative self-concepts
- Healing from intergenerational trauma
- Finding authentic self-expression
- Building genuine connections across differences
- Transforming destructive relationship patterns

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Primary Elements:
- Core: Integration of healing and empowerment through love
- Manifestation: Self-reclamation, authentic relationships, collective healing
- Development: Personal → interpersonal → collective → systemic
- Relationships: Self ↔ community ↔ larger systems

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Transformative love that heals deep psychological wounds while building authentic connections and new ways of relating. It operates simultaneously as self-acceptance, interpersonal authenticity, and collective healing force, working to transform inherited patterns of harm into life-affirming relationships with self, others, and community.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents love's capacity to heal and transform at multiple levels simultaneously. It begins with radical self-acceptance despite internalized negative messages, extends through authentic connections that transcend social barriers, and manifests as a collective force for healing historical wounds and creating new patterns of relationship.

The quality combines deep tenderness with transformative power, enabling both personal healing and systemic change. It operates through recognition of shared humanity while honoring differences, creating spaces where authentic self-expression and genuine connection become possible despite historical or social divisions.

[Manifestations]
- Deep self-acceptance that transcends internalized negative messages
- Capacity to form authentic relationships across social divisions
- Active participation in collective healing processes
- Creation of new relationship patterns based on mutual recognition
- Ability to hold both wounded and empowered aspects of self/others
- Generation of transformative spaces for authentic connection
- Integration of personal healing with social transformation

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a spiral pattern of healing and expansion. It begins with recognition of internalized harm patterns and moves through stages of self-acceptance, authentic connection with others, and participation in collective healing. Each stage reinforces and deepens the others, creating an expanding capacity for transformative relationship with self and others.

In practice, it manifests as the ability to maintain deep self-acceptance while engaging authentically with others, to participate in healing spaces while contributing to their creation, and to build new relationship patterns while helping others do the same. This quality enables both personal liberation and collective transformation through the medium of authentic connection and mutual recognition.
```

This universalized version aims to:
- Preserve the transformative power of the original concept
- Make it accessible across cultural contexts
- Maintain both personal and collective dimensions
- Keep practical applicability clear
- Connect individual experience to universal patterns
- Retain sophistication while using accessible language

The description emphasizes observable manifestations and practical development while maintaining the depth and transformative potential of the original concept. It connects personal healing with collective transformation in a way that should be recognizable across cultural contexts.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
