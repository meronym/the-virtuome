Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Integration of psychological health and spiritual development
Key functions: 
- Balancing growth across dimensions
- Integration of shadow aspects
- Emotional-spiritual harmony
- Authentic development

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Growing wisdom through life experience
- Integrating difficult experiences

- Facing personal truth

STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary patterns:
- Progressive integration

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to develop wholeness through integrating life experiences, emotional depth, and existential awareness, characterized by balanced growth across all dimensions of human experience while maintaining authenticity and practical wisdom in daily life.

[Essential Nature]
Psychospiritual maturity represents the natural convergence of emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and deeper understanding that emerges through fully engaging with life's experiences. It manifests as an increasing ability to hold complexity while maintaining simplicity, to face difficulty while preserving peace, and to navigate both ordinary and extraordinary dimensions of experience with grace and practical wisdom. This quality reflects the natural ripening of human consciousness when supported by honest self-reflection, genuine openness to experience, and consistent integration of insights.

[Manifestations]
- Maintaining emotional balance while exploring deeper dimensions of experience
- Integrating insights and challenges rather than avoiding or clinging to them
- Expressing authenticity while respecting contextual appropriateness
- Holding both personal truth and multiple perspectives simultaneously
- Demonstrating practical wisdom in daily life while remaining open to mystery
- Balancing individual development with relationship to larger whole
- Meeting life's challenges with both strength and vulnerability

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the natural interaction between life experience and conscious integration, supported by genuine self-reflection and openness to growth. It operates as an integrating function within consciousness, continuously synthesizing new experiences, insights, and understandings into an increasingly stable yet flexible foundation of wisdom. The process involves repeated cycles of challenge, integration, and expansion, leading to greater depth and breadth of understanding.

In practical terms, this maturity expresses itself through balanced responses to life situations, wisdom in relationships, authentic self-expression, and the capacity to navigate both ordinary and extraordinary experiences with equanimity. It enables one to maintain groundedness while exploring depths, to hold multiple perspectives while staying true to one's path, and to contribute meaningfully to others' development while continuing one's own growth process.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: Uses universal human experiences and developmental patterns
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language
3. Practical applicability: Clear connections to daily life and relationships
4. Individual-universal connection: Links personal development to universal patterns
5. Developmental clarity: Shows how quality grows through experience and integration
6. Observable manifestations: Focuses on concrete expressions and behaviors

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the specified criteria?
