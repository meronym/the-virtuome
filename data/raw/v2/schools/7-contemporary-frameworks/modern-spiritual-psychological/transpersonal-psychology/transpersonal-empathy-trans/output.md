[Core Definition]
The innate human capacity to deeply sense, understand, and respond to the experiences of others beyond personal boundaries, recognizing our fundamental interconnectedness. This expanded empathy naturally embraces an ever-widening circle of concern, from immediate others to all beings, while maintaining practical groundedness.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the natural evolution of human empathy beyond its conventional limits. It begins with the recognition that our ability to feel with and for others isn't limited by personal relationships or immediate presence. As this capacity develops, artificial boundaries between self and other become increasingly transparent, revealing our underlying unity of experience.

This expanded empathy isn't an abstract spiritual concept but a concrete human potential that emerges through psychological development and conscious cultivation. It combines immediate emotional resonance with broader awareness, allowing simultaneous attention to individual experiences and their universal context.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous recognition of shared feelings across apparent boundaries
- Natural concern extending beyond personal circles to all beings
- Balanced sensitivity that neither overwhelms nor disconnects
- Practical compassion that responds appropriately to different scales of need
- Simultaneous awareness of individual and collective dimensions
- Integration of heart-centered feeling with clear understanding

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive expansion of our natural empathic capacity. It begins with individual encounters that break through usual emotional barriers, gradually building toward a more stable recognition of our shared experience. This development involves both emotional refinement and perspective broadening, supported by direct experiences of profound interconnection that verify our essential unity.

In practical terms, this expanded empathy manifests as naturally appropriate responses to suffering and joy at any scale. It enables effective compassionate action without burnout by maintaining clear boundaries while accessing deeper connection. This balance allows engagement with both individual and collective challenges while preserving personal wellness and functional capacity.
