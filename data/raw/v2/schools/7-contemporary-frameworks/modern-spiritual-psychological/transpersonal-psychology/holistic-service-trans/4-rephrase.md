Let me follow the systematic process to universalize the concept of Holistic Service.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Conscious action that serves development/wellbeing at multiple levels
Key functions: Integration of individual growth with collective benefit
Relationship patterns: Links personal development to social impact
Developmental aspects: Progresses from individual service to systemic transformation

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences: Helping others, contributing to community, personal growth through giving
Parallel concepts: Social responsibility, stewardship, caregiving, mentorship
Contemporary relevance: Social innovation, sustainable development, systemic change
Timeless patterns: Growth through giving, individual-collective integration

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to contribute to the wellbeing and development of others in ways that simultaneously foster personal growth and systemic positive change. It manifests as action that intentionally serves multiple levels - individual, interpersonal, and collective - while maintaining awareness of their interconnection.

[Essential Nature]
Holistic service emerges from recognizing that personal development and collective wellbeing are inseparable aspects of human flourishing. It transcends simple helping behavior by consciously integrating individual growth with broader positive impact, creating recursive cycles of development where serving others enhances self-development, which in turn increases capacity for service. This quality represents mature human action that naturally benefits both self and others simultaneously.

[Manifestations]
- Offering help in ways that empower rather than create dependency
- Taking actions that address immediate needs while building long-term capacity
- Contributing skills and resources in ways that catalyze positive systemic change
- Creating opportunities that enable others' growth while continuing to learn and develop
- Engaging in work that simultaneously serves personal purpose and collective good
- Developing solutions that address multiple levels of need concurrently
- Building relationships and systems that foster ongoing mutual development

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through heightened awareness of the interconnected nature of individual and collective development. It manifests when personal capabilities and insights are channeled into action that serves broader wellbeing, while the act of service itself becomes a vehicle for deeper personal growth and understanding. This creates virtuous cycles where service enhances capacity for service.

In practice, it expresses as carefully considered action that addresses immediate needs while building long-term resilience and capability. Whether through mentoring, creating systems, sharing resources, or catalyzing change, holistic service consistently generates multiple layers of benefit - meeting current needs while developing future capacity, supporting individuals while strengthening communities, and solving problems while preventing their recurrence.
```

This universalization:
1. Maintains the sophistication of transpersonal psychology's understanding
2. Makes the concept accessible without specialized knowledge
3. Emphasizes observable manifestations and practical applications
4. Links individual development to collective benefit
5. Preserves the developmental and transformative aspects
6. Connects to universal human experiences of helping and growth

Would you like me to adjust any aspect to better meet the objectives?
