Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: The capacity for unified, multi-level awareness
Key functions: Integration, synthesis, holistic perception
Relationship patterns: Bridges different modes of consciousness
Developmental aspects: Progresses from fragmented to unified awareness

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Moments of clarity and comprehensive understanding
- Recognition of interconnections
- Experiences of wholeness
- Integration of different perspectives

STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Primary function: Unifying different aspects of experience
Observable impacts: Enhanced understanding, better decision-making, wisdom
Development: From partial to complete awareness
Systemic role: Meta-capacity that enhances other capacities

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to perceive, hold, and unify multiple dimensions of experience simultaneously, enabling a comprehensive understanding that bridges ordinary awareness with deeper levels of knowing. This faculty allows for the integration of different ways of knowing while maintaining practical groundedness.

[Essential Nature]
Integrative awareness operates as a meta-capacity that brings together different streams of perception and understanding into a coherent whole. Like a prism working in reverse, it unifies seemingly separate aspects of experience—thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, intuitions, and transpersonal insights—into a single, clear awareness. This quality develops naturally through experience but can be cultivated deliberately, leading to increasingly comprehensive and nuanced understanding of both self and world.

[Manifestations]
- Simultaneous awareness of multiple perspectives without confusion
- Natural synthesis of intellectual, emotional, and intuitive knowing
- Fluid movement between different modes of understanding
- Recognition of patterns and connections across contexts
- Balance between analytical precision and holistic comprehension
- Integration of ordinary and non-ordinary states of consciousness
- Practical wisdom that combines insight with effective action

[Functional Description]
This quality functions by creating a field of awareness that can hold apparent opposites without conflict, enabling different aspects of experience to inform and enrich each other. Rather than switching between different modes of understanding, it maintains a unified perspective that recognizes the validity and limitation of each mode while transcending their individual boundaries. This capacity grows through exposure to diverse experiences and conscious practice in holding multiple perspectives.

In daily life, integrative awareness manifests as enhanced decision-making that naturally considers multiple factors, improved relationships through understanding different viewpoints, and more effective problem-solving through access to multiple ways of knowing. It enables one to maintain practical effectiveness while accessing deeper insights, leading to actions that are both wise and pragmatic. This quality serves as a foundation for developing other capacities and virtues, as it provides the container within which they can work together harmoniously.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: ✓ (Uses universal human experiences)
2. Depth preservation: ✓ (Maintains sophistication while being accessible)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (Clear connections to daily life)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (Links personal experience to universal capacity)
5. Developmental clarity: ✓ (Shows progression and cultivation)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (Clear behavioral/experiential markers)

The description aims to maintain the sophistication of transpersonal psychology while making it accessible through universal human experiences and practical applications. It preserves the depth while removing specialized terminology and culture-specific references.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect to better meet the objectives?
