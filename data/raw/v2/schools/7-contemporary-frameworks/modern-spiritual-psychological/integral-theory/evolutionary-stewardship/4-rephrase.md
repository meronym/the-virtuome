Let me go through the preparation process first:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Conscious participation in developmental processes
Key functions:
- Recognition of evolutionary dynamics
- Active participation in growth processes
- Responsibility for collective development
- Integration of multiple time scales
- Systemic awareness and intervention

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Growth and development
- Responsibility for future outcomes
- Collective progress/improvement
- Intentional change
- Care for future generations

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Recognition of developmental potential
- Active participation in growth
- Multi-scale responsibility
- Future-oriented care
- Systemic awareness

Secondary Elements:
- Short vs long-term balance
- Individual-collective integration
- Resource stewardship
- Developmental guidance
- Sustainable progress

Now, here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to consciously participate in and take responsibility for positive development across multiple scales - from personal growth to collective advancement. It combines awareness of developmental processes with active engagement in nurturing beneficial change, while maintaining consideration for long-term consequences and systemic health.

[Essential Nature]
This quality emerges from the human capacity to recognize patterns of growth and development, combined with our ability to intentionally influence these patterns. It manifests as a deep sense of responsibility for nurturing positive change, coupled with the wisdom to understand developmental processes and the patience to work with their natural rhythms.

At its core, it represents the marriage of awareness and care - awareness of how things grow and develop, and care for the future unfolding of potential. This includes understanding the interconnected nature of development across different scales and domains, from individual growth to cultural evolution to environmental sustainability.

[Manifestations]
- Active support of growth and development in others
- Long-term thinking in decision-making and planning
- Careful consideration of systemic impacts and consequences
- Balanced attention to individual and collective development
- Nurturing of sustainable positive change
- Recognition and support of emerging beneficial patterns
- Integration of immediate needs with future possibilities

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through continuous awareness of developmental processes coupled with active engagement in supporting and guiding these processes. It involves recognizing patterns of growth and change, understanding their natural rhythms and requirements, and taking responsible action to support beneficial development while preventing harmful patterns. This awareness-action dynamic operates across multiple scales, from personal relationships to organizational systems to cultural patterns.

In practice, it manifests as careful attention to the conditions that support healthy development, combined with patient, persistent action to nurture these conditions. This includes making choices that consider long-term impacts, supporting others in their growth, contributing to collective development, and maintaining awareness of how current actions influence future possibilities. It requires balancing immediate needs with long-term considerations, and individual benefits with collective wellbeing.

This universalization aims to:
- Preserve the developmental emphasis while making it accessible
- Connect to universal human experiences of growth and care
- Maintain sophistication while using phenomenological language
- Link individual experience to collective responsibility
- Keep practical relevance while including deeper principles

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
