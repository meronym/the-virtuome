Let me follow the analytical process step by step:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: The capacity to understand and facilitate growth processes
Functions: 
- Recognition of developmental patterns
- Facilitation of growth
- Navigation of transitions
- Integration of stages
Systemic role: Meta-capacity enabling evolution of other capacities

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Personal growth moments
- Learning transitions
- Mentoring relationships
- Life stage changes
- Skill development

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary pattern: Recognition -> Understanding -> Facilitation -> Integration
Key relationships: 
- Individual to collective development
- Theory to practice
- Present to potential
- Part to whole development

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, understand, and consciously participate in growth processes - both in oneself and others. It combines deep insight into how humans develop with the practical wisdom to facilitate this development, manifesting as an intuitive understanding of what enables or hinders growth at any given stage.

[Essential Nature]
Developmental wisdom operates as a meta-capacity that integrates experiential understanding with practical knowledge about how humans grow and transform. It transcends mere theoretical knowledge about development, emerging as an embodied sensitivity to the rhythms and patterns of growth across all dimensions of human experience. This wisdom includes recognition of developmental readiness, understanding of growth challenges, awareness of integration needs, and insight into the delicate balance between support and challenge needed for optimal development.

[Manifestations]
- Intuitive recognition of developmental readiness and barriers
- Skillful facilitation of growth processes without forcing or inhibiting
- Natural ability to meet others at their level while holding space for their potential
- Recognition of growth patterns across different domains and contexts
- Balanced application of challenge and support in developmental situations
- Integration of multiple lines of development (cognitive, emotional, social, etc.)
- Awareness of both individual and collective development dynamics

[Functional Description]
This capacity operates through continuous attunement to developmental processes, combining pattern recognition with experiential understanding. It functions by maintaining simultaneous awareness of present conditions and future potentials, while recognizing the unique path each person or system must take. This wisdom emerges through extensive experience with growth processes, refined by reflection and integrated understanding of how development actually occurs in real situations.

In practice, developmental wisdom manifests as the ability to create optimal conditions for growth while recognizing and working with natural developmental timing. It enables one to serve as a catalyst for development without attachment to specific outcomes, maintaining awareness of multiple developmental lines while honoring the organic nature of growth processes. This capacity becomes increasingly refined through experience, leading to more subtle and effective ways of supporting development in all contexts.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the sophisticated understanding from Integral Theory
2. Makes it accessible without requiring knowledge of the framework
3. Connects to universal human experiences of growth and development
4. Maintains practical applicability
5. Captures both individual and collective dimensions
6. Links theory to practice through experiential description

The description passes the verification questions by:
- Using language and concepts meaningful across cultures
- Preserving the depth of integral developmental understanding
- Providing clear practical applications
- Connecting individual to universal aspects
- Explaining developmental progression
- Offering observable manifestations

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
