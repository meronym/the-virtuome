Let me follow the process systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Meta-perspective integration capacity
Key functions: 
- Multiple perspective holding
- Dynamic synthesis
- Multi-dimensional awareness
- Coherent complexity navigation
Systemic role: Meta-capability enabling other capabilities

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Growing understanding of multiple viewpoints
- Recognizing larger patterns
- Sensing interconnections
- Expanding awareness
Contemporary applications:
- Complex problem solving
- Cross-cultural understanding
- Systems leadership
- Personal development

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary:
- Integration capacity
- Perspective expansion
- Pattern recognition
- Coherent synthesis
Secondary:
- Cognitive overwhelm (obstacle)
- Practice and reflection (conditions)
- Wisdom and complexity tolerance (related)
- Decision-making and leadership (applications)

Here's the universalized description following the requested format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to perceive, hold, and integrate multiple dimensions of experience simultaneously while maintaining practical coherence and effectiveness. It represents the mind's natural evolution toward greater inclusiveness and synthesis, expressing through enhanced understanding, decision-making, and action.

[Essential Nature]
This quality manifests as an expanding ability to recognize and work with the inherent complexity of life while maintaining clarity and functionality. It develops through the progressive recognition that reality has many valid perspectives and dimensions, all of which contribute to a fuller understanding. Unlike mere intellectual comprehension, it represents an embodied capacity to navigate multiple viewpoints, levels, and systems while maintaining practical groundedness.

This integration happens not through forced effort but through the natural maturation of awareness, supported by experience and reflection. It enables one to hold seemingly contradictory views simultaneously, recognizing their partial truths and relationships within larger patterns of meaning and functionality.

[Manifestations]
- Recognizing valid aspects of conflicting viewpoints while maintaining clear discernment
- Navigating complex situations with both detailed attention and broad perspective
- Connecting seemingly separate domains into coherent understanding
- Making decisions that consider multiple dimensions and impacts
- Maintaining effectiveness while holding increasing levels of complexity
- Supporting others' growth while continuing one's own development
- Translating complex understanding into simple, practical actions

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through progressive expansion of awareness combined with increasing capacity for synthesis. It develops through cycles of differentiation (recognizing distinct perspectives and dimensions) and integration (seeing their interconnections and patterns). As awareness expands, it naturally seeks greater coherence, leading to more inclusive and nuanced understanding while maintaining practical functionality.

In daily life, this expresses as enhanced ability to navigate complexity with grace, make more comprehensive decisions, and take more effective action. It enables one to maintain clarity amid confusion, find creative solutions to complex problems, and support both individual and collective development. This capacity serves as a meta-skill, enhancing all other capabilities through broader understanding and more integrated application.

This universalized description:
1. Uses phenomenological rather than theoretical language
2. Connects to universal human experiences
3. Maintains sophistication while increasing accessibility
4. Preserves core meaning while removing culture-specific references
5. Emphasizes practical manifestations and development
6. Links individual experience to universal patterns

The description passes the verification questions by:
1. Using concepts recognizable across cultures
2. Maintaining the depth of integral awareness
3. Emphasizing practical applications
4. Connecting personal to universal aspects
5. Describing developmental patterns
6. Providing observable manifestations

Would you like me to revise any aspect to better meet the objectives?
