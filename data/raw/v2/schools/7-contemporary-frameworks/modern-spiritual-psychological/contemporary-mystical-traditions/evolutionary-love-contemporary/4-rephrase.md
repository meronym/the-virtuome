Let me follow the process systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Dynamic force of care that drives development and growth
Key functions: 
- Motivates evolution and transformation
- Creates coherence in systems
- Enables transcendence of ego-boundaries
- Facilitates emergence of higher order complexity

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Care that extends beyond personal interest
- Growth through relationship
- Creative impulse toward development
- Sense of contributing to something greater

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary pattern: Progressive expansion of care and conscious participation in development
Key relationships: Individual↔Collective, Being↔Becoming, Personal↔Universal

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The innate capacity for care that transcends personal interest and drives development, expressing as an active force that promotes growth, integration, and the emergence of greater possibilities in both self and others. It manifests as a creative impulse toward positive transformation and a deep commitment to the flourishing of the whole.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the dynamic aspect of care that specifically enables and promotes development. Unlike simple compassion or affection, it carries an active evolutionary impulse that recognizes unrealized potential and works toward its actualization. It operates simultaneously at personal, interpersonal, and systemic levels, expressing as an intimate force that both nurtures and challenges, supporting growth while maintaining coherence.

This care-in-action transcends mere sentiment, functioning as a creative force that participates in the development of life itself. It combines profound appreciation for what is with clear recognition of what could be, generating the dynamic tension necessary for genuine transformation.

[Manifestations]
- Deep recognition of potential in self, others, and situations
- Active support of growth even when challenging or uncomfortable
- Natural extension of care beyond personal boundaries
- Spontaneous contribution to collective development
- Creative engagement with obstacles as opportunities
- Sustained commitment to long-term evolution
- Balance of nurturing support with transformative challenge

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by maintaining dynamic tension between current reality and emergent possibilities, creating conditions that foster development while preserving essential coherence. It works through progressive expansion of care and consciousness, transforming self-interest into collective interest, and personal development into contribution to the whole. The capacity grows through conscious participation in developmental processes and regular engagement with transformative challenges.

In practical expression, it manifests as sustained commitment to growth-oriented relationships, creative problem-solving that benefits the whole, and natural contribution to collective development. It enables navigation of complex challenges through combination of deep care and evolutionary perspective, consistently choosing responses that support the highest potential of any situation while maintaining practical effectiveness.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the evolutionary dimension while grounding it in universal human experience
2. Maintains sophistication while using accessible language
3. Connects individual experience to universal principles
4. Emphasizes practical manifestations and development
5. Retains depth while removing tradition-specific references
6. Links abstract principles to concrete expressions

The description passes verification questions by:
- Using universally recognizable human experiences
- Maintaining philosophical depth
- Providing clear practical applications
- Connecting personal and universal dimensions
- Outlining development pathway
- Describing observable manifestations

Would you like me to adjust any aspect to better meet the objectives?
