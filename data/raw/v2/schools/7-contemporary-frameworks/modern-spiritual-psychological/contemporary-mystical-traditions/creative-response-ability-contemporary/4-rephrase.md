Let me follow the systematic process to universalize this virtue concept.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Dynamic integration of awareness, wisdom, and action
Key functions: 
- Spontaneous appropriate response
- Integration of freedom and responsibility
- Wise engagement with emergent situations
- Creative problem-solving
- Ethical discernment in action

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Facing unexpected situations
- Needing to act without complete information
- Balancing multiple considerations
- Meeting novel challenges
- Responding versus reacting

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary patterns:
- Awareness → Discernment → Action
- Freedom ↔ Responsibility
- Wisdom ↔ Spontaneity
- Individual ↔ Collective impact

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to respond to life's situations with spontaneous wisdom, combining clear awareness, creative intelligence, and ethical responsibility. It manifests as the ability to meet each moment freshly while maintaining coherent principles, expressing both freedom and responsibility in dynamic balance.

[Essential Nature]
Creative Response-ability represents the integration of awareness, wisdom, and action in human experience. It transcends both rigid reactivity and chaotic impulsivity, expressing instead as a fluid capacity to meet each situation with fresh intelligence while maintaining ethical coherence. This quality combines the spontaneity of natural response with the wisdom of considered action, enabling appropriate engagement with life's complexity without becoming trapped in hesitation or falling into automatic patterns.

[Manifestations]
- Responding to situations with fresh intelligence rather than conditioned patterns
- Maintaining ethical coherence while adapting to new circumstances
- Balancing individual insight with awareness of broader impact
- Expressing spontaneous wisdom in practical action
- Integrating freedom and responsibility in dynamic balance
- Meeting challenges with both creativity and stability

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through continuous integration of multiple capacities: present-moment awareness that perceives situations clearly; discernment that understands appropriate action; creative intelligence that finds novel solutions; and practical wisdom that implements effectively. It develops through progressive refinement of awareness, deepening of wisdom, and expansion of response capacity, supported by both contemplative practice and active engagement with real-world challenges.

In practical expression, Creative Response-ability enables individuals to navigate complex situations with both freedom and responsibility, finding innovative solutions while maintaining ethical coherence. It manifests as the capacity to remain fully present to challenges, draw upon deep wisdom, and act with spontaneous appropriateness, creating responses that serve both immediate circumstances and longer-term well-being of all involved.

This universalized description maintains the sophisticated understanding of the original concept while making it accessible through:
- Focus on common human experiences
- Clear behavioral manifestations
- Practical developmental trajectory
- Balance of individual and collective aspects
- Connection of abstract principles to concrete expression

The description satisfies the verification questions by:
1. Using universally relatable experiences and concepts
2. Preserving the sophisticated integration of awareness, wisdom, and action
3. Providing clear practical applications
4. Connecting personal capacity to broader impact
5. Outlining developmental progression
6. Specifying observable manifestations

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universalization further?
