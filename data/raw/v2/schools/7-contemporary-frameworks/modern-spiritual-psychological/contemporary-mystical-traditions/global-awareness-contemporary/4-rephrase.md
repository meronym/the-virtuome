Let me follow the process systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Recognition and conscious participation in larger systems of life
Functions: Integration, connection, responsibility, perspective-taking
Systemic role: Meta-awareness that contextualizes other virtues
Developmental: Moves from intellectual to experiential to embodied

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Wonder at night sky
- Feeling part of something larger
- Recognition of interconnection in nature
- Sense of shared humanity
- Experience of expanding awareness

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary elements:
- Awareness expansion capacity
- Recognition of interconnection
- Participatory consciousness
- Systemic understanding

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The innate human capacity to sense, understand, and consciously participate in larger systems of life, from local ecosystems to planetary dynamics. It manifests as an expanding sphere of awareness, care, and responsibility that naturally develops from personal to universal scope while remaining grounded in direct experience and practical action.

[Essential Nature]
Global awareness represents the mind's natural ability to expand beyond immediate concerns to recognize and engage with progressively larger contexts of existence. Like a zooming camera lens, it can shift between intimate detail and vast perspective, integrating both into a coherent whole. This quality combines clear perception of interconnected systems with felt participation in those systems, bridging objective understanding with subjective experience.

This awareness operates simultaneously as a form of knowing, a way of being, and a capacity for action. It develops through direct experience rather than abstract concept, growing naturally as consciousness expands while remaining anchored in immediate reality.

[Manifestations]
- Recognition of patterns and relationships across different scales of life
- Spontaneous sense of care and responsibility extending beyond personal sphere
- Natural integration of local and global perspectives in decision-making
- Felt sense of participation in larger systems and processes
- Practical engagement with collective challenges and opportunities
- Balanced attention to immediate experience and larger contexts
- Embodied understanding of interconnection in daily life

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a natural expansion of awareness and care, similar to how a child's world naturally grows from family to community to increasingly broader spheres. It operates through direct perception rather than conceptual understanding, involving the whole being rather than just the intellect. As it develops, it transforms how we perceive our place in the world, shifting from an isolated individual to a conscious participant in life's larger patterns.

In practical terms, global awareness manifests as an enhanced capacity to sense and respond appropriately to different scales of reality simultaneously. It enables more effective action by providing broader context for local decisions, while ensuring abstract understanding remains grounded in direct experience. This results in more integrated decision-making, more authentic relationships, and more effective engagement with complex challenges.

This universalized description:
- Grounds abstract concepts in universal human experience
- Maintains sophistication while increasing accessibility
- Emphasizes practical manifestation and development
- Links individual experience to universal patterns
- Preserves depth while expanding relevance
- Focuses on observable phenomena rather than theory
- Provides clear pathway for practical application

The description connects to universal human experiences while maintaining the sophistication of contemporary mystical understanding. It emphasizes how this quality manifests experientially rather than theoretically, making it more accessible across cultures while preserving its essential depth.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
