Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: The capacity for clear seeing and wise discrimination across multiple dimensions of reality and experience
Functions: Navigation of complexity, integration of perspectives, wise judgment
Systemic role: Enables coherent action in complex situations, bridges understanding and action
Developmental: Progresses from simple discrimination to multi-perspective integration to wisdom

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Making sense of complex situations
- Distinguishing truth from falsehood
- Navigating multiple viewpoints
- Making wise decisions
- Integrating different types of knowledge

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary patterns:
- Clear seeing
- Wise discrimination
- Integration of perspectives
- Practical wisdom
- Evolutionary context

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to see clearly and judge wisely across multiple dimensions of experience, integrating different ways of knowing while maintaining practical effectiveness. It combines sharp discrimination with inclusive understanding, enabling coherent navigation of life's complexity while recognizing deeper patterns and principles.

[Essential Nature]
Clear discernment operates as an integrative capacity that brings together intellectual understanding, intuitive knowing, bodily wisdom, and practical experience. It functions like a refined instrument of perception that can distinguish subtle differences while maintaining awareness of the whole. Unlike mere analytical thinking, it encompasses both precise discrimination and holistic understanding, allowing for navigation of complexity without losing sight of essential truths.

This quality develops through the integration of direct experience, reflected understanding, and tested wisdom. It combines the clarity of a focused lens with the breadth of a wide-angle perspective, enabling both detailed examination and comprehensive vision.

[Manifestations]
- Ability to distinguish truth from appearance across multiple contexts
- Capacity to hold and integrate different perspectives without confusion
- Clear recognition of patterns and principles beneath surface complexity
- Practical wisdom in navigating challenging situations
- Natural integration of multiple ways of knowing (rational, intuitive, somatic)
- Balanced judgment that considers both details and whole
- Ability to recognize appropriate action in complex situations

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interaction between focused attention and expanded awareness, continuously refining the ability to perceive and understand clearly. It develops through conscious practice of attention, reflection on experience, and integration of multiple ways of knowing. As it matures, it enables increasingly subtle discrimination while maintaining connection to practical wisdom and effectiveness.

In daily life, this manifests as the ability to navigate complex situations with clarity and wisdom, making decisions that account for multiple factors while remaining grounded in fundamental principles. It enables one to see both the forest and the trees, maintaining precision without losing perspective, and supporting wise action that addresses both immediate circumstances and longer-term implications.

This universalized description aims to:
- Preserve the sophistication of integral discernment while making it accessible
- Connect it to universal human experiences of perception and decision-making
- Maintain practical relevance while including deeper dimensions
- Make it understandable across cultural contexts
- Include both individual and collective dimensions
- Preserve the developmental aspect

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this description?
