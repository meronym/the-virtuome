Let me follow the structured process to universalize the Egyptian concept of Metenu.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Alignment of action with cosmic-moral order
Key functions: 
- Ethical discernment
- Just action
- Fair dealing
- Protection of proper order
- Balance of interests

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Sensing fairness/unfairness
- Making difficult ethical choices
- Balancing competing interests
- Protecting vulnerable parties
- Maintaining social harmony

STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Recognition of moral truth
- Active implementation
- Progressive development
- Systemic impact

Secondary:
- Internal resistance
- Social pressures
- Supporting virtues
- Practical challenges

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, uphold, and actively implement what is fundamentally right and fair, manifesting as a dynamic balance between moral insight and practical action. This quality enables one to perceive ethical truth and manifest it through decisions and behaviors that serve both individual and collective wellbeing.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the active bridge between moral understanding and practical implementation, operating as both an perceptive faculty and an executive capacity. It manifests as a deep-seated recognition of what is fundamentally right, coupled with the commitment and capability to manifest this understanding in concrete ways. Unlike passive moral knowledge or mere rule-following, it requires continuous dynamic engagement with real situations, demanding both clarity of perception and courage of action.

[Manifestations]
- Clear discernment between right and wrong in complex situations
- Balanced consideration of all relevant factors in decision-making
- Active protection of the vulnerable or disadvantaged
- Fair allocation of resources, responsibilities, and consequences
- Harmonious resolution of conflicts and competing interests
- Progressive refinement of ethical judgment through experience
- Practical implementation of moral insights in challenging contexts

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through repeated cycles of moral perception and ethical action, each informing and reinforcing the other. Initial intuitive recognition of fairness evolves into sophisticated ethical discernment through exposure to increasingly complex situations. The capacity strengthens as one faces and resolves challenging moral decisions, gradually building both wisdom and practical effectiveness.

In daily life, it operates as an active force for maintaining social harmony while promoting individual growth. It enables one to navigate complex ethical terrain while maintaining integrity, balancing multiple interests without compromising fundamental principles. This quality serves as a practical bridge between individual conscience and collective wellbeing, manifesting as actions that simultaneously serve personal development and social good.

This universalization attempts to:
1. Capture the essential dynamic between perception and action
2. Preserve the depth of moral discernment
3. Maintain practical applicability
4. Connect individual development with collective impact
5. Describe observable manifestations
6. Outline clear developmental progression

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: Uses universal human experiences of fairness and ethical action
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding of moral discernment and action
3. Practical applicability: Includes concrete manifestations and development path
4. Individual-universal connection: Links personal development to collective impact
5. Development clarity: Describes progressive refinement through experience
6. Observable manifestations: Lists concrete behavioral expressions

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the objectives?
