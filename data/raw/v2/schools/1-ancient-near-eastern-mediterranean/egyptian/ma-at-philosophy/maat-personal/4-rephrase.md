Let me follow the structured approach to universalize Ma'at's personal aspect.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Integration of personal truth/integrity with universal order
Key functions: 
- Alignment of individual with cosmic law
- Internal coherence of thought/speech/action
- Harmonization of personal/social/universal domains
Systemic role: Foundation for all other virtues

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Sense of internal coherence/discord
- Recognition of truth/falsity in self
- Experience of alignment/misalignment
- Feeling of harmony/discord with larger order

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to achieve and maintain internal truth-alignment: a state where thought, feeling, speech, and action form a coherent whole that resonates with deeper patterns of reality. This alignment manifests as personal integrity while simultaneously connecting individual conduct with universal principles of order and harmony.

[Essential Nature]
Truth-alignment operates at multiple levels simultaneously: as an internal state of coherence, as an active force for harmonizing different aspects of life, and as a bridge between personal conduct and universal principles. It represents the human capacity to recognize, embody, and maintain accordance between inner truth and outer reality.

This quality serves as a foundation for all other virtues by establishing the basic integrity and coherence necessary for genuine development. It creates a stable platform for growth by ensuring that our various aspects - thoughts, emotions, words, and actions - work in harmony rather than opposition.

[Manifestations]
- Internal coherence: thoughts, feelings, words, and actions align
- Truth-speaking: natural expression of internal reality without distortion
- Ethical clarity: immediate recognition of right action in situations
- Harmonious conduct: actions that naturally create order rather than chaos
- Authentic presence: being genuinely oneself while appropriately adapted to context
- Integrative understanding: seeing how parts relate to wholes
- Resolution of cognitive/emotional dissonance

[Functional Description]
Truth-alignment develops through an iterative process of recognition and integration. We first become aware of internal contradictions or misalignments through their felt effects - confusion, tension, or discord. This awareness creates opportunities to realign our various aspects, gradually building greater internal coherence. Each successful integration strengthens our capacity to maintain alignment in increasingly challenging circumstances.

In practice, this quality manifests as a natural authenticity that requires no effort to maintain. Actions flow spontaneously from clear understanding, speech naturally reflects inner truth, and behavior automatically harmonizes with larger patterns of order. This creates a foundation of reliability and integrity that others can sense and trust, while simultaneously connecting personal conduct with universal principles of order and harmony.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural validity: Uses universal human experiences of coherence/discord
2. Depth preservation: Maintains connection between personal/universal aspects
3. Practical applicability: Clear pathway for development and practice
4. Individual-Universal connection: Links personal integrity to universal order
5. Developmental clarity: Describes process of recognition and integration
6. Observable manifestations: All listed manifestations are experientially verifiable

The description preserves the sophisticated integration of personal and universal aspects central to Ma'at while making it accessible through universal human experiences of alignment/misalignment and harmony/discord.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
