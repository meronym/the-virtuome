Let me follow the analytical process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF REKH:
Core principle: Sacred/deep knowledge that transforms the knower
Key functions: 
- Integration of understanding and being
- Transmission of wisdom
- Cultural/spiritual preservation
- Practical application of deep knowledge
Systemic role: Bridge between divine/cosmic understanding and practical wisdom

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Deep learning that changes perspective
- Wisdom that transforms behavior
- Knowledge that connects theory and practice
- Understanding that reveals deeper patterns
- Integration of knowledge and character

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Progressive deepening of understanding
- Integration of knowledge levels
- Transformation through understanding
- Practical wisdom emergence

Secondary:
- Surface vs deep knowledge distinction
- Theory-practice integration
- Wisdom transmission challenges
- Personal transformation process

Now, the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to acquire, integrate, and embody deep understanding that transforms both knowledge and knower, uniting theoretical comprehension with practical wisdom and personal development. This quality manifests as the progressive integration of learning with being, leading to demonstrable wisdom in action.

[Essential Nature]
Deep knowing (Rekh) represents the human capacity to move beyond surface learning to transformative understanding. It encompasses the integration of intellectual knowledge with experiential wisdom, theoretical understanding with practical application, and personal insight with universal principles. This quality develops through progressive stages of deepening comprehension, each level transforming both the knowledge itself and the one who knows.

Unlike mere accumulation of information, this quality represents the alchemy of understanding where knowledge becomes wisdom through integration with one's being. It manifests in the ability to perceive underlying patterns, apply understanding appropriately, and transmit wisdom effectively to others.

[Manifestations]
- Progressive transformation of understanding from theoretical to embodied knowledge
- Natural integration of learning with practical application
- Capacity to recognize and work with fundamental patterns and principles
- Ability to transmit understanding effectively to others
- Development of wisdom that influences character and behavior
- Clear perception of connections between specific instances and universal principles
- Demonstration of knowledge through transformed action rather than mere articulation

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a spiral process where intellectual understanding deepens into experiential wisdom, which then enables new levels of comprehension. Each cycle integrates knowledge more fully into one's being, transforming both understanding and character. The process requires active engagement with knowledge through reflection, application, and testing against reality, leading to progressively deeper levels of integration.

In practical expression, this quality manifests as natural wisdom in action, where understanding flows smoothly into appropriate response without gap between knowledge and application. It shows in the ability to teach others effectively, to recognize patterns across different domains, and to maintain perspective that unites practical detail with broader principles. The quality becomes visible through transformed behavior, enhanced perception, and the capacity to illuminate understanding in others.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the transformative aspect of the original Egyptian concept
2. Makes it accessible to modern understanding
3. Maintains the integration of sacred and practical dimensions
4. Emphasizes observable manifestations
5. Provides clear developmental pathway
6. Connects individual development to universal principles

The description meets the verification criteria by:
- Being culturally translatable
- Preserving the depth of the original concept
- Providing clear practical applications
- Connecting personal to universal
- Outlining development process
- Focusing on observable manifestations

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the objectives?
