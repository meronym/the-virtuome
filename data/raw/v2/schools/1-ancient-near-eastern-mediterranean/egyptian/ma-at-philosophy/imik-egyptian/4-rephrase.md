Let me follow the systematic approach for Imi-k (Reciprocal Care).

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Mutual supportive responsibility within social networks
Key functions: 
- Maintains social cohesion
- Ensures collective wellbeing
- Creates resilient communities
- Builds intergenerational stability

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Interdependence
- Community support
- Social reciprocity
- Collective care
- Mutual aid

Here's the universal language reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to perceive, maintain, and actively participate in networks of mutual care and reciprocal support, recognizing the fundamental interdependence of human wellbeing and acting to strengthen the fabric of collective flourishing through conscious reciprocity and proactive responsibility for others' welfare.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the conscious embodiment of human interdependence through active participation in networks of mutual support. It operates as both an awareness and a practice, combining clear recognition of our fundamental interconnectedness with practical commitment to maintaining the web of reciprocal care that sustains community life. Unlike simple altruism or generic kindness, it specifically concerns the cultivation and maintenance of sustainable support networks through balanced giving and receiving.

The quality manifests as a dynamic balance between receiving support, providing assistance, and maintaining the social infrastructure that makes both possible. It requires emotional intelligence to perceive needs, practical wisdom to respond effectively, and social awareness to maintain healthy boundaries and sustainable practices.

[Manifestations]
- Actively participating in community support systems
- Maintaining awareness of others' needs and capabilities
- Contributing resources, time, and energy where needed
- Gracefully receiving support when appropriate
- Creating and sustaining structures for mutual aid
- Building long-term reciprocal relationships
- Developing systemic solutions to collective challenges

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive expansion of care from immediate family to wider circles of community. It begins with direct experiences of receiving and giving support, evolving into more sophisticated understanding of social ecosystems and how to maintain them. The capacity grows through practical engagement with community needs, learning from others' examples, and gradually assuming greater responsibility for collective wellbeing.

In practice, it operates through multiple channels: direct personal assistance, participation in community initiatives, creation of support structures, and cultivation of reciprocal relationships. It manifests in daily acts of mutual support, long-term commitment to community projects, and strategic efforts to build sustainable social infrastructure. The quality becomes particularly visible during times of collective challenge, when networks of reciprocal care prove essential for community resilience.

This universalization maintains the core Egyptian concept while making it accessible across cultures by:

1. Focusing on universal human experiences of interdependence and mutual support
2. Emphasizing observable manifestations and practical applications
3. Describing development patterns relevant to any cultural context
4. Connecting individual actions to collective outcomes
5. Preserving the sophisticated understanding of social ecosystems
6. Maintaining the balance between receiving and giving
7. Highlighting contemporary relevance for community resilience

The reformulation addresses the verification questions by:
1. Using universally recognizable phenomena and experiences
2. Preserving the sophisticated Egyptian understanding of social reciprocity
3. Providing clear practical applications
4. Connecting personal practice to collective wellbeing
5. Outlining clear developmental progression
6. Focusing on observable behaviors and outcomes

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the objectives?
