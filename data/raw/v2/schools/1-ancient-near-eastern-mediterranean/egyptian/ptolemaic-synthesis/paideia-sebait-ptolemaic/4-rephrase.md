Let me follow the analytical process for Paideia-Sebait:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Transformative development through integrated learning
Functions: Personal growth, cultural transmission, wisdom cultivation
Systemic role: Bridge between individual potential and cultural ideals
Developmental aspects: Progressive integration of knowledge, character, and wisdom

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS:
Universal experiences:
- Learning and personal growth
- Cultural understanding
- Character development
- Wisdom acquisition
- Integration of knowledge and being

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Primary Elements:
- Transformative learning
- Cultural embodiment
- Practical wisdom
- Integrated development
- Personal excellence

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for transformative development through integrated learning, where knowledge, character, and wisdom unite to create deeper understanding and enhanced being. This quality enables the progressive refinement of human potential through the conscious integration of understanding, practice, and inner development.

[Essential Nature]
Transformative learning represents the human capacity to evolve through the conscious integration of knowledge, experience, and inner development. It operates through multiple dimensions simultaneously: intellectual understanding deepens through practice, character develops through applied wisdom, and cultural understanding transforms into embodied knowledge. This quality creates a dynamic synthesis between learning and being, where each new level of understanding catalyzes further personal evolution.

[Manifestations]
- Progressive integration of theoretical knowledge with practical wisdom
- Development of nuanced understanding through multiple perspectives
- Emergence of enhanced capacities through applied learning
- Translation of cultural understanding into embodied knowledge
- Cultivation of wisdom through integrated experience
- Evolution of character through conscious development
- Synthesis of personal growth with cultural understanding

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous cycle of learning, integration, and transformation. It begins with the acquisition of knowledge but quickly evolves into deeper understanding through practice and reflection. As theoretical understanding meets lived experience, new capacities emerge. This process creates successive layers of development, each building upon and transforming previous levels of understanding.

In practical terms, it manifests as the ability to learn deeply from experience, integrate multiple perspectives, and develop enhanced capabilities through conscious practice. It enables individuals to transform knowledge into wisdom, cultural understanding into embodied truth, and personal development into expanded human capacity. This quality bridges the gap between potential and actualization through integrated development.

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: ✓ (focuses on universal human capacity for development)
2. Depth preservation: ✓ (maintains sophisticated developmental model)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear connection to learning and development)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (links personal growth to broader development)
5. Developmental clarity: ✓ (explicit progression model)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (concrete expressions identified)

The universalized description preserves the sophisticated developmental model of the original Ptolemaic concept while making it accessible and applicable across cultural contexts. It maintains the depth of the original virtue while expressing it in terms of universal human experience and capacity.
