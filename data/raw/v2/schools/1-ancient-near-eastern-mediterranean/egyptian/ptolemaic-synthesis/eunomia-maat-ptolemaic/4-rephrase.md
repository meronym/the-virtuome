Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Eunomia-Maat:
Core principle: The alignment of human social order with deeper natural/cosmic patterns
Key functions: 
- Harmonizing social systems with natural law
- Creating sustainable order
- Balancing structure and flow
- Integrating individual and collective needs

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Sensing when systems "flow right" vs. feel discordant
- Experiencing well-functioning vs. dysfunctional organizations
- Recognizing natural rhythms and patterns
- Feeling harmony/discord between personal and collective needs

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Perception of natural order
- Implementation of aligned systems
- Development of harmonious relationships
- Integration across scales

Secondary:
- Resistance to natural patterns
- Supporting environmental conditions
- Related organizational qualities
- Practical governance applications

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to perceive, create, and maintain systems of order that align with natural patterns and universal principles, enabling harmonious flow between individual and collective needs while fostering sustainable development at all scales of human organization.

[Essential Nature]
This quality manifests as a deep sensitivity to underlying patterns of order combined with the practical ability to implement these patterns in human systems. It operates through the recognition of natural rhythms, relationships, and organizing principles, then translating these into sustainable structures and processes that support both individual flourishing and collective harmony.

At its core, it represents the bridge between our intuitive understanding of natural order and our conscious creation of human systems, always seeking the sweet spot where structure enables rather than constrains life's natural flow.

[Manifestations]
- Ability to sense when systems are in/out of alignment with natural patterns
- Skill in designing and implementing harmonious organizational structures
- Capacity to balance stability and adaptability in systems
- Natural authority that comes from alignment with deeper principles
- Creation of environments where individual and collective needs mutually support each other
- Development of sustainable practices that work with rather than against natural patterns
- Integration of formal structures with organic development

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through careful observation of natural patterns and principles, combined with practical experience in organizing human systems. It begins with growing sensitivity to harmony and discord in existing systems, progresses through understanding of fundamental organizing principles, and matures into the ability to create and maintain aligned systems at increasing scales of complexity. The development process requires both intuitive pattern recognition and analytical understanding, integrating direct perception with practical implementation.

In practice, it manifests as the ability to create environments and systems where things "just work" - where rules and structures support rather than hinder natural development, where individual and collective needs align rather than conflict, and where organization emerges organically rather than being imposed artificially. This results in sustainable systems characterized by high functionality, low maintenance requirements, and natural authority based on alignment rather than force.
```

This universalization maintains the core insights of Eunomia-Maat while making them accessible to those without knowledge of Greek or Egyptian traditions. It preserves the sophisticated understanding of the relationship between natural and human order while expressing it in experiential rather than theoretical terms.

The description connects individual perception and development to universal principles, maintains practical applicability, and clearly indicates how this quality manifests in observable ways. It should be meaningful across cultures while preserving the depth of the original concept.

Would you like me to verify this against specific criteria or revise any particular aspect?
