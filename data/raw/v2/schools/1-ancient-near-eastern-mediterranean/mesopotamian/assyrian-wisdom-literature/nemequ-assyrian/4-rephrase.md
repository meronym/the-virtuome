Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF NÄ’MEQU:

Core Principle:
- Integration of knowledge, understanding, and skillful action
- Unification of theoretical and practical wisdom
- Combines divine insight with earthly competence

Key Functions:
- Decision-making guidance
- Knowledge integration
- Skill development
- Situation assessment
- Cultural transmission

Systemic Role:
- Bridges divine and human realms
- Connects knowledge to action
- Links individual development to societal function
- Integrates technical and ethical domains

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:

Universal Experiences:
- Learning from experience
- Developing expertise
- Making complex decisions
- Teaching others
- Integrating knowledge domains

Contemporary Parallels:
- Professional wisdom
- Expert judgment
- Practical wisdom
- Integrated understanding
- Experiential learning

Based on this analysis, here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Integrative wisdom that unifies knowledge, understanding, and skillful action. It represents the capacity to comprehend deeply, judge accurately, and act effectively across multiple domains of life, combining theoretical insight with practical competence and ethical understanding.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the highest form of practical wisdom, where knowledge, experience, and understanding converge into a unified capacity for effective action. It manifests as a dynamic integration of multiple forms of intelligence: theoretical comprehension, practical know-how, ethical judgment, and situational awareness. Unlike mere knowledge or skill alone, it encompasses the ability to perceive what is essential, understand what is needed, and act with appropriate precision.

This wisdom operates as both a culmination of development and an ongoing process of growth, continuously integrating new experiences and insights into an expanding framework of understanding. It bridges the gap between knowing and doing, between universal principles and particular situations, between technical expertise and ethical judgment.

[Manifestations]
- Accurate assessment of complex situations without oversimplification
- Effective decision-making that balances multiple factors and perspectives
- Natural integration of new experiences into existing understanding
- Ability to transfer insights across different domains and contexts
- Balanced judgment that combines technical expertise with ethical awareness
- Capacity to teach and transmit understanding to others
- Practical effectiveness that flows from deep comprehension

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive integration of experience, knowledge, and understanding. It begins with basic competence in specific areas, gradually expanding through reflection on experience and active engagement with challenges. As it matures, it enables increasingly sophisticated pattern recognition, more nuanced judgment, and more effective action. The development process involves both formal learning and experiential wisdom, combining systematic knowledge with intuitive understanding.

In practice, this wisdom manifests as a seemingly effortless capacity to navigate complex situations, make sound decisions, and guide others effectively. It enables one to see beyond surface appearances to underlying patterns, to anticipate consequences of actions, and to find balanced solutions to complex problems. This quality becomes particularly evident in challenging situations where multiple factors must be weighed, or when standard approaches prove insufficient.

This universalized description aims to:
- Preserve the integrative nature of the original concept
- Maintain the connection between knowledge and action
- Capture both individual and collective aspects
- Keep the practical focus while retaining philosophical depth
- Make the concept accessible without oversimplification

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Uses universal human experiences of learning and development
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding of wisdom's nature
3. Practical applicability: Clear connection to real-world situations
4. Individual-universal connection: Links personal development to broader patterns
5. Development clarity: Explicit description of growth process
6. Observable manifestations: Concrete, verifiable expressions listed

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
