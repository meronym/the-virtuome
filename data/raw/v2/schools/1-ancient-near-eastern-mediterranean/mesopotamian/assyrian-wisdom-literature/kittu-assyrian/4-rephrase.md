Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF KÄªTTU:

Core Principle:
- Alignment between cosmic order and human action
- Unity of truth and justice
- Foundational ordering principle

Key Functions:
- Maintaining social order
- Guiding judgment
- Ensuring fairness
- Upholding truth
- Connecting divine/human realms

Systemic Role:
- Foundation for legitimate authority
- Basis for trust
- Framework for decisions
- Standard for behavior

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:

Universal Experiences:
- Recognition of natural order
- Sense of fairness
- Truth-seeking
- Need for stability
- Desire for justice

Contemporary Parallels:
- Institutional integrity
- Ethical leadership
- Truth in communication
- Systemic fairness
- Professional standards

Based on this analysis, here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The fundamental capacity to recognize, align with, and manifest truth and rightness in thought, speech, and action. It combines clear perception of what is with the active commitment to bring human affairs into harmony with deeper principles of order and fairness.

[Essential Nature]
Truth-justice represents the human faculty for discerning and implementing natural order in social reality. It operates simultaneously as an perceptive capacity (recognizing what is true), an ethical compass (distinguishing right action), and an executive force (implementing fair solutions). This quality bridges individual conscience with universal principles, manifesting as both personal integrity and social justice.

Beyond mere factual accuracy or rule-following, it embodies the active alignment of human affairs with deeper patterns of cosmic order. It requires both clear seeing and courageous action, combining wisdom with practical implementation.

[Manifestations]
Personal Domain:
- Consistent alignment between inner conviction and outer action
- Clear discrimination between truth and falsehood
- Natural authority derived from integrity
- Courage to uphold truth despite opposition

Social Domain:
- Fair and impartial judgment in conflicts
- Creation of trust-based relationships
- Establishment of reliable systems and processes
- Protection of legitimate rights and responsibilities

Universal Domain:
- Recognition of natural order and principles
- Integration of cosmic and human dimensions
- Maintenance of harmony between parts
- Service to enduring truth over temporary advantage

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of perception and action. It begins with basic truth-telling and fair dealing, evolves through increasingly subtle discrimination of right action, and matures into natural alignment with universal principles. The journey involves facing personal biases, resisting expedient compromises, and developing courage to uphold truth despite challenges.

In practice, it manifests as trustworthy character, clear judgment, and the capacity to create order from chaos. It enables leadership that inspires trust, decision-making that stands the test of time, and the ability to resolve conflicts through higher principles rather than mere compromise. Those embodying this quality naturally become reference points for others, creating ripples of truth and fairness in their sphere of influence.

This universalized description aims to:
- Preserve the profound cosmic-social integration of the original concept
- Make it accessible through universal human experiences
- Maintain practical applicability across contexts
- Connect individual development to universal principles
- Provide observable markers of development

The description passes the verification questions by:
1. Using phenomenological language accessible across cultures
2. Preserving the depth of cosmic-social integration
3. Providing clear practical applications
4. Connecting personal integrity to universal order
5. Outlining developmental progression
6. Offering observable manifestations

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
