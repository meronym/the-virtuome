Let me work through this systematically for Kīttu.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: The alignment of human action with fundamental truth/order
Functions: Judicial, social ordering, moral compass, cosmic-earthly bridge
Systemic role: Foundational ordering principle connecting divine/human realms
Development: From concrete justice to abstract truth principle

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Recognition of fundamental patterns/order
- Sense of rightness/truth
- Need for fair dealings
- Alignment of action with principle

STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Primary: Truth-justice unity manifesting as right action
Secondary: Social harmony through aligned conduct

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, align with, and manifest fundamental truth through right action. It represents the unity of understanding and implementation, where deep recognition of what is true naturally expresses itself as just and proper conduct in all domains of life.

[Essential Nature]
This quality emerges from the human capacity to perceive and align with fundamental patterns of reality. It bridges the gap between abstract truth and concrete action, manifesting as an integrated form of knowing-doing where understanding naturally flows into appropriate conduct. Unlike mere intellectual understanding or rule-following, it represents a state of direct recognition that spontaneously generates right action.

The quality develops through progressive refinement of perception and conduct, moving from external guidance to internal recognition, and from mechanical adherence to natural expression. It serves as both a guiding principle and a measure of development, indicating the degree to which one's actions align with fundamental truth.

[Manifestations]
- Clear recognition of proper action in complex situations
- Natural alignment of conduct with deeper principles
- Consistent expression of fairness in dealings with others
- Spontaneous maintenance of harmony in relationships and systems
- Integration of understanding and action in leadership
- Development from rule-following to principle-recognition to natural expression
- Bridge-building between theoretical understanding and practical implementation

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a progressive refinement of perception and action. Initially experienced as recognition of external order and rules, it develops into direct insight into the proper nature of things. This insight naturally manifests as appropriate action without the need for intermediate reasoning or external enforcement. The development process involves increasingly subtle recognition of patterns and principles, coupled with growing capacity for spontaneous right action.

In practical expression, this quality manifests as natural leadership, wise judgment, and the ability to maintain harmony in complex systems. It enables one to navigate challenging situations with wisdom, make decisions that serve the greater good, and maintain proper relationships at all levels. The quality is particularly evident in the ability to resolve conflicts, establish sustainable order, and guide others through example rather than force.
```

This universalized description aims to:
1. Preserve the profound unity of truth and justice in the original concept
2. Maintain the practical focus on manifestation/implementation
3. Capture the developmental aspect from external to internal guidance
4. Connect individual development to universal principles
5. Keep the bridge function between abstract truth and concrete action

Does this successfully meet the quality criteria while maintaining the essence of Kīttu?
