Let me apply the analytical framework to Mīšaru:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Practical righteousness manifesting as equitable treatment
Key functions:
- Balancing competing interests
- Ensuring fair distribution
- Protecting vulnerable parties
- Maintaining social harmony
- Implementing abstract justice in concrete situations

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Sensing unfairness
- Seeking fair solutions
- Balancing different needs
- Protecting weaker parties
- Making difficult trade-offs
- Implementing ideals practically

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary elements:
- Active principle of fairness
- Practical wisdom in application
- Social harmony maintenance
- Economic balance
- Rights protection

Now, the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The active capacity to establish and maintain fairness in practical situations, combining clear recognition of what is right with the wisdom to implement it effectively. It manifests as the ability to create and sustain equitable relationships, fair exchanges, and balanced solutions that serve the genuine needs of all parties involved.

[Essential Nature]
Practical fairness operates as a dynamic balancing force that bridges the gap between abstract ideals of justice and concrete situations requiring resolution. It combines keen discernment of what is truly equitable with the practical wisdom to implement fair solutions in complex situations. This quality enables one to consider multiple perspectives, recognize genuine needs, and craft solutions that serve the authentic interests of all parties while maintaining social harmony.

Unlike abstract principles of justice, practical fairness works directly with real-world constraints and opportunities, finding ways to achieve the most equitable outcomes possible within given circumstances. It requires both moral clarity and practical wisdom, manifesting as the ability to create sustainable, balanced solutions that all parties can genuinely accept and maintain.

[Manifestations]
- Crafting solutions that address all parties' legitimate needs
- Maintaining fair and transparent exchanges in business and personal dealings
- Protecting vulnerable parties while respecting everyone's dignity
- Finding creative ways to balance competing interests
- Implementing idealistic principles through practical means
- Building sustainable, equitable relationships and systems
- Recognizing and correcting hidden imbalances and inequities

[Functional Description]
Practical fairness operates through a continuous process of perception, evaluation, and creative implementation. It begins with clear recognition of what genuine equity would look like in a given situation, then works systematically to realize that vision through available means. This quality combines moral sensitivity with practical problem-solving, always seeking ways to align real-world outcomes with deeper principles of justice.

In daily life, this manifests as the consistent ability to create and maintain fair arrangements that actually work. It shows up in business dealings that truly serve all parties, in conflict resolutions that address root causes, in resource distributions that acknowledge real needs, and in relationship patterns that support everyone's authentic development. The result is sustainable harmony based on genuine equity rather than mere compromise or forced agreement.

This universalized description aims to:
- Preserve the practical wisdom emphasis of the original Babylonian concept
- Make it accessible across cultures while maintaining sophistication
- Connect individual conduct with systemic impacts
- Emphasize observable manifestations and practical applications
- Maintain the dynamic, active nature of the original virtue

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the stated objectives?
