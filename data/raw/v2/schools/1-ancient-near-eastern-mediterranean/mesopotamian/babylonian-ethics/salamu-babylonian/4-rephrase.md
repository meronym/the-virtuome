Let me analyze Šalāmu following our framework:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
- Core: Integration of parts into harmonious whole
- Functions: Peace-making, completion, wholeness restoration
- Systemic Role: Maintains social-personal-cosmic harmony
- Development: From physical completeness to holistic wellbeing

UNIVERSALIZATION:
- Universal Experiences: Harmony, peace, completion, integration
- Parallel Concepts: Wholeness, peace, integrity, completion
- Contemporary Applications: Conflict resolution, holistic health, systems thinking
- Timeless Patterns: Integration, harmony-seeking, completion-driving

Here's the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to perceive, create, and maintain wholeness across all dimensions of experience. It manifests as the active integration of parts into harmonious wholes, the restoration of broken relationships, and the achievement of completion in both personal and collective contexts.

[Essential Nature]
Wholeness-making operates as a fundamental integrative force that recognizes fragmentation as a temporary state and continuously works toward higher levels of harmony and completion. It functions simultaneously at personal, interpersonal, and systemic levels, creating coherence between seemingly separate elements. This quality enables the recognition of underlying unity within apparent diversity and activates the natural tendency of systems toward integration and balance.

[Manifestations]
- Ability to see connections between apparently separate elements
- Capacity to resolve conflicts by finding higher-order integration
- Skill in completing unfinished processes and relationships
- Drive to establish harmony in disruptive situations
- Talent for maintaining balance across complex systems
- Recognition and restoration of broken patterns
- Creation of sustainable, integrated solutions

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous process of recognition, integration, and harmonization. It begins with the awareness of fragmentation or incompleteness, proceeds through understanding the nature of separation, and culminates in active integration. The process involves both analytical comprehension of parts and intuitive grasp of potential wholeness, working simultaneously at multiple levels of experience.

In practical expression, it manifests as the ability to resolve conflicts without creating new divisions, to heal relationships while honoring all parties, and to create sustainable solutions that benefit entire systems. This quality enables individuals and groups to move from fragmentation to integration, from conflict to peace, and from incompleteness to wholeness in ways that serve the highest good of all involved.

This universal description of Šalāmu:
1. Preserves the original Babylonian concept's depth and sophistication
2. Makes it accessible across cultural contexts
3. Maintains practical applicability
4. Links individual experience to universal principles
5. Provides clear developmental pathway
6. Offers observable manifestations
7. Retains both practical and philosophical dimensions

The description emphasizes experiential understanding while preserving the sophisticated systemic awareness inherent in the original concept. It connects personal peace with collective harmony and practical completion with cosmic wholeness, making the virtue relevant across contexts while maintaining its essential meaning.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universal description to better meet our objectives?
