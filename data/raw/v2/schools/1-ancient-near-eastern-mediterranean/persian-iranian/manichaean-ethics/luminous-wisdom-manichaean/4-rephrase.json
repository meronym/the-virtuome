      "content": "Let me think through this systematically:\n\nANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK:\n1. Manichaean ethics fundamentally centers on the liberation of light from darkness, making this the ultimate ethical orientation.\n2. The tradition has both a cosmic and personal dimension that need to be represented.\n3. There's a hierarchical structure (Elect vs. Hearers) that influences virtue expression.\n4. The system is notably practical despite its cosmic scope.\n\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS:\n1. The most representative virtues should reflect:\n- The light/darkness dualism\n- The path to spiritual liberation\n- Both personal and cosmic dimensions\n- Practical ethical conduct\n- Knowledge/wisdom aspects\n\n2. We should prioritize virtues that:\n- Appear consistently across different Manichaean texts\n- Have clear practical applications\n- Connect personal conduct to cosmic purpose\n- Show the distinctive character of Manichean ethics\n\n3. Important distinctions:\n- Some virtues are means, others are ends\n- Some apply to all followers, others specifically to the Elect\n- Some are more fundamental, others derivative\n\nREASONING FOR SELECTION:\n1. Need core virtues reflecting the fundamental orientation toward light\n2. Must include both cognitive and practical dimensions\n3. Should represent both individual and communal aspects\n4. Must capture the unique Manichaean synthesis of various traditions\n5. Should reflect both immediate conduct and ultimate purpose\n\nPROPOSED SHORTLIST:\n\n1. LUMINOUS WISDOM (\u0631\u0648\u0634\u0646\u200c\u062e\u0631\u062f\u06cc / ro\u0161an-xeradi)\n- Primary orientation toward divine light\n- Foundation for all other virtues\n- Combines knowledge and spiritual illumination\n\n2. SALVIFIC DISCERNMENT (\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0bc7\u0b95\u0bae\u0bcd / vivekam)\n- Ability to distinguish light from darkness\n- Practical wisdom in daily choices\n- Guide for ethical decision-making\n\n3. PURIFYING DISCIPLINE (\u067e\u0627\u06a9\u06cc\u0632\u06af\u06cc / pakizagi)\n- Physical and spiritual purification\n- Practical conduct supporting liberation\n- Includes dietary and behavioral disciplines\n\n4. COMPASSIONATE LIBERATION (\u89e3\u812b\u6148\u60b2 / ji\u011btuo c\u00edb\u0113i)\n- Active work to free light particles\n- Universal compassion for entrapped light\n- Practical expression of cosmic purpose\n\n5. TRUTHFUL HARMONY (\u0631\u0627\u0633\u062a\u06cc / r\u0101st\u012b)\n- Alignment with cosmic truth\n- Honest speech and conduct\n- Integration of personal and cosmic order\n\n6. MINDFUL GUARDIANSHIP (\u0646\u06af\u0647\u0628\u0627\u0646\u06cc / negahb\u0101ni)\n- Protection of light elements\n- Environmental awareness\n- Responsible stewardship\n\n7. ENLIGHTENED FELLOWSHIP (\u0647\u0645\u0628\u0633\u062a\u06af\u06cc / hambastagi)\n- Community support and solidarity\n- Mutual aid in liberation\n- Hierarchical responsibility\n\n8. TRANSCENDENT KNOWLEDGE (\u06af\u0646\u0648\u0633\u06cc\u0633 / gnosis)\n- Direct knowing of divine truth\n- Transformative understanding\n- Ultimate salvific wisdom\n\nThis shortlist:\n- Covers both practical and cosmic dimensions\n- Includes personal and communal aspects\n- Represents both means and ends\n- Captures distinctive Manichaean features\n- Links daily practice to ultimate purpose\n- Reflects the tradition's synthetic nature\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Develop full YAML nodes for these eight virtues?\n2. Adjust the selection based on additional criteria?\n3. Provide more detailed textual support for any particular virtue?\n4. Explore the relationships between these virtues?"
