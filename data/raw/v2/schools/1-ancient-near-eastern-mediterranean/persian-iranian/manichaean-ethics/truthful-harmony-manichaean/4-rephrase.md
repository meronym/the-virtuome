Let me follow the analytical process step by step:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Alignment between truth and reality across multiple dimensions
Key functions:
- Harmonizing personal conduct with cosmic order
- Maintaining integrity between thought/speech/action
- Facilitating authentic relationship with reality
- Creating coherence between individual and universal

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Seeking authentic self-expression
- Desire for coherence/meaning
- Experience of alignment/flow
- Recognition of larger patterns/order

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary patterns:
- Progressive alignment of inner/outer reality
- Integration of personal/universal truth
- Development from simple honesty to cosmic harmony
- Movement from partial to complete authenticity

Now, following the requested format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of deep authenticity and alignment that emerges when personal truth harmonizes with universal reality. It manifests as a dynamic coherence between thought, speech, and action, while resonating with the fundamental patterns of existence. This alignment creates a natural flow between individual conduct and cosmic order.

[Essential Nature]
Rāstī represents the human capacity for authentic alignment with reality at all levels. It begins as simple truthfulness but develops into a comprehensive harmony between inner experience and outer expression, personal conduct and universal principles. This quality creates a natural resonance between individual consciousness and the deeper patterns of existence, manifesting as a form of lived truth that transcends mere factual accuracy or ethical honesty.

Unlike simple truthfulness, it encompasses a dynamic relationship with reality itself, creating a state of coherent flow between personal awareness, interpersonal relationships, and universal principles. This alignment generates a characteristic clarity and power that naturally harmonizes various aspects of life and experience.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent alignment between thoughts, words, and actions
- Natural authenticity in self-expression and relationships
- Fluid adaptation to reality without distortion or resistance
- Clear perception of underlying patterns and principles
- Spontaneous harmony between personal conduct and universal order
- Progressive refinement of understanding through lived experience
- Integration of practical wisdom with cosmic awareness

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of one's relationship with truth and reality. It begins with basic honest communication and ethical conduct but evolves toward deeper recognition and embodiment of fundamental patterns. As alignment deepens, it creates a natural resonance between personal consciousness and universal principles, manifesting as increasingly effortless harmony in thought and action.

In practical terms, it operates as an integrating force that brings coherence to all aspects of life and experience. This alignment manifests as clear perception, authentic expression, and natural wisdom in action. It creates a characteristic flow state where personal conduct naturally harmonizes with larger patterns, leading to both practical effectiveness and deeper realization of truth.

This universalized description aims to:
1. Preserve the depth of the Manichaean concept while making it accessible
2. Connect individual practice to universal principles
3. Maintain both practical applicability and philosophical sophistication
4. Describe observable manifestations and development patterns
5. Relate to universal human experiences and aspirations

Would you like me to:
1. Expand any particular aspect?
2. Provide more concrete examples?
3. Further clarify the development process?
4. Elaborate on practical applications?
