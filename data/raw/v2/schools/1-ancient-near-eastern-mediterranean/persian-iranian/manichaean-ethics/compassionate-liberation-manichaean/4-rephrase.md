Let me follow the structured approach to universalize this concept.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Active liberation through compassion
Functions: 
- Release of trapped potential
- Universal healing action
- Conscious intervention
- Transformative care

Key patterns:
- Individual action → Universal effect
- Understanding → Intervention
- Compassion → Liberation
- Recognition → Responsibility

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Recognizing potential in others/situations
- Feeling called to helpful action
- Sensing interconnection
- Responsible stewardship

Contemporary parallels:
- Environmental restoration
- Personal development coaching
- Transformational leadership
- Systemic healing work

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The active capacity to recognize latent potential in all situations and beings, combined with the compassionate wisdom to facilitate its liberation through conscious intervention. This quality manifests as both careful discernment and loving action, aimed at universal flourishing through the release of trapped or blocked potential.

[Essential Nature]
Liberative compassion operates at the intersection of deep seeing and active care. It begins with the recognition that all beings and situations contain inherent potential that may be constrained or unrealized. This recognition naturally evolves into skillful action guided by universal compassion, where the practitioner becomes an active agent of transformation through careful, conscious intervention.

This quality combines acute discernment with heartfelt responsibility. It transcends mere sympathy to become a practical force for positive change, operating simultaneously at personal, interpersonal, and systemic levels. The practitioner develops both the wisdom to recognize where intervention is needed and the skill to facilitate transformation without causing harm.

[Manifestations]
- Acute recognition of unrealized potential in situations and beings
- Skillful intervention to release blocked energy or capacity
- Careful stewardship of resources and relationships
- Active participation in healing and restoration processes
- Development of precise discernment paired with universal care
- Creation of conditions that support natural unfolding
- Conscious facilitation of growth and transformation

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressively refined attention to the dynamics of constraint and liberation in all situations. It begins with cultivating sensitivity to blocked potential and restricted expression, evolving into an understanding of how gentle yet persistent intervention can facilitate natural unfolding. The practitioner learns to recognize signs of trapped vitality and develops skills for its careful release, while maintaining awareness of systemic implications.

In practical expression, liberative compassion manifests as conscious participation in transformative processes at multiple scales. It might appear as environmental restoration work, mentoring relationships, conflict resolution, or systemic change initiatives. The practitioner becomes adept at identifying leverage points where careful intervention can initiate positive cascade effects, always guided by the twin lights of wisdom and compassion.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the core Manichaean insight about active liberation of light/potential
2. Translates cosmic/metaphysical framework into observable phenomena
3. Maintains practical applicability
4. Connects individual action to universal impact
5. Provides clear developmental trajectory
6. Offers verifiable manifestations

The description should be:
- Meaningful across cultural contexts
- True to the original depth
- Practically applicable
- Clear in connecting personal/universal
- Specific about development
- Observable in real situations

Would you like me to:
1. Refine any particular aspect?
2. Add more practical examples?
3. Elaborate on developmental stages?
4. Clarify specific manifestations?
