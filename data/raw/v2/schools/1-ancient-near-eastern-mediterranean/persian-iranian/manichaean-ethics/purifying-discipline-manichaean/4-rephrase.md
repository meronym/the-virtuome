Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Pakizagi:
Core principle: Purification as active engagement with life-force
Key functions: 
- Preservation of vital energy
- Refinement of consciousness
- Protection of essential qualities
- Integration of physical/spiritual domains
Systemic role: Facilitates transformation through conscious relationship with matter/energy

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Sense of cleansing/renewal
- Distinction between vital/depleting influences
- Recognition of quality/degradation
- Experience of refinement/cultivation

3. STRUCTURAL INTEGRATION:
Primary pattern: Conscious cultivation of life-affirming qualities through disciplined engagement
Key relationships: Links personal conduct to universal vitality

Here's the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The active cultivation of vital integrity through conscious engagement with life's fundamental energies and substances. This quality manifests as the disciplined refinement of one's relationship with physical reality, transforming routine interactions into opportunities for the preservation and enhancement of essential life forces.

[Essential Nature]
Vital integrity represents the dynamic capacity to recognize, preserve, and enhance life-sustaining qualities in all domains of experience. It operates through refined discernment of what truly nourishes versus what depletes, extending beyond mere physical cleanliness to encompass the conscious stewardship of life's fundamental energies. This quality develops through progressive refinement of one's relationship with matter, energy, and consciousness, transforming mechanical habits into opportunities for vital enhancement.

[Manifestations]
- Mindful consumption: Conscious discrimination in food, drink, and sensory inputs
- Environmental attunement: Heightened awareness of and response to environmental quality
- Energetic discipline: Careful management of vital forces through daily choices
- Refined conduct: Development of actions that preserve and enhance life quality
- Conscious relationship: Engagement with physical reality as a field of vital potential
- Transformative stewardship: Converting routine activities into opportunities for enhancement

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through heightened awareness of the vital dimension inherent in all physical interactions. It develops through progressive refinement of perception and response, enabling increasingly subtle discrimination between life-enhancing and life-diminishing influences. The practice involves conscious engagement with daily activities - eating, breathing, moving, interacting with environments - transforming them from mechanical processes into opportunities for vital cultivation.

In practical expression, this manifests as careful attention to food choices, environmental quality, energy management, and physical conduct. It transforms routine activities into opportunities for vital enhancement, developing increasingly refined relationships with matter and energy. This creates a dynamic feedback loop where greater awareness leads to more conscious choices, which in turn enhance perceptual refinement and vital capacity.
