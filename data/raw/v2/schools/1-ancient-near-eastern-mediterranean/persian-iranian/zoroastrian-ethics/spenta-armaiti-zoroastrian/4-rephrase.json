      "content": "Let me think through this systematically:\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n\n1. FOUNDATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Zoroastrianism is fundamentally about moral choice and active participation in the cosmic struggle between good and evil\n- The tradition emphasizes practical ethics over abstract philosophy\n- The core teaching revolves around the threefold path of good thoughts, words, and deeds\n\n2. STRUCTURAL IMPORTANCE:\n- The Amesha Spentas (divine attributes) represent ideal qualities humans should cultivate\n- The concept of Asha (truth/order) is absolutely central and influences all other virtues\n- Personal responsibility and active choice are paramount\n\n3. PRACTICAL EMPHASIS:\n- Zoroastrian ethics focus on concrete actions and real-world applications\n- Environmental stewardship and social responsibility are key elements\n- The tradition values both individual development and communal harmony\n\n4. SELECTION CRITERIA:\n- Must include foundational concepts that shape the tradition's worldview\n- Should represent both individual and social dimensions\n- Must capture both contemplative and active aspects\n- Should reflect the tradition's emphasis on progress and renewal\n- Must include virtues that bridge spiritual and practical domains\n\n5. HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT:\n- Consider both early (Gathic) and later developments\n- Include virtues that have shown sustained importance\n- Consider those that have demonstrated practical value through history\n\nBased on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of core representative virtues:\n\nCORE ZOROASTRIAN VIRTUES:\n\n1. ASHA (Truth/Cosmic Order)\n- The fundamental principle underlying all other virtues\n- Represents both cosmic truth and personal righteousness\n- The foundation of ethical decision-making\n\n2. VOHU MANAH (Good Mind/Purpose)\n- Active ethical intelligence\n- Capacity for moral discernment\n- Bridge between divine wisdom and human action\n\n3. SPENTA ARMAITI (Holy Devotion/Wisdom)\n- Practical wisdom in action\n- Right relationship with creation\n- Active care for the world\n\n4. SRAOSHA (Spiritual Discipline/Obedience)\n- Attentive listening to truth\n- Disciplined practice\n- Moral vigilance\n\n5. HAITHYA (Truthfulness)\n- Personal integrity\n- Honest speech and action\n- Alignment with Asha in daily life\n\n6. DAENA (Conscience/Religious Insight)\n- Inner moral compass\n- Spiritual discernment\n- Self-awareness\n\n7. MITHRA (Covenant-Keeping)\n- Faithfulness to commitments\n- Social responsibility\n- Ethical relationships\n\n8. HUVARSTAY (Good Action)\n- Active expression of ethics\n- Practical righteousness\n- Manifesting good in the world\n\n9. FRASHOKERETI (Progressive Renewal)\n- Continuous improvement\n- Active participation in world renewal\n- Ethical evolution\n\nThis selection:\n- Covers both theoretical and practical dimensions\n- Includes both personal and social virtues\n- Represents both contemplative and active aspects\n- Maintains connection to fundamental principles while including practical applications\n- Shows progression from understanding (Asha) through discernment (Vohu Manah) to action (Huvarstay)\n- Culminates in the progressive aspect (Frashokereti) that characterizes the tradition\n\nEach of these virtues contains multiple layers of meaning and application, and together they provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and practicing Zoroastrian ethics.\n\nWould you like me to develop full YAML nodes for any or all of these core virtues?"
