Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS - DAĒNĀ:
- Core phenomenon: Inner knowing/seeing that guides moral choice
- Functions: Discernment, conscience, spiritual insight, self-reflection
- Systemic role: Bridge between universal truth and personal action
- Developmental aspect: Grows through conscious cultivation of wisdom

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
- Universal experiences: Moral intuition, inner guidance, conscience
- Parallel concepts: 
  * Conscience (Western)
  * Viveka (Hindu discernment)
  * Prajna (Buddhist wisdom)
  * Inner Light (Quaker)
- Contemporary relevance: Ethical decision-making, personal development, authentic living

Here's my attempt at a universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The faculty of inner knowing that combines moral intuition, spiritual insight, and self-awareness. It functions as an internal compass that recognizes truth, discerns right action, and guides personal development through direct inner perception rather than external rules or reasoning alone.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the innate human capacity for direct moral and spiritual perception - the ability to "see" rather than merely think about what is true and right. It operates as a form of immediate knowing that precedes rational analysis, though it can be refined and strengthened through conscious development. Unlike purely emotional impulse or logical deduction, it integrates multiple ways of knowing: intuitive recognition, ethical discernment, and spiritual insight.

This knowing manifests both as momentary clarity in specific situations and as a gradually developing wisdom that shapes one's entire way of being. It serves as a bridge between universal principles and personal action, between abstract truth and lived experience.

[Manifestations]
- Immediate recognition of truth or rightness in situations without need for analysis
- Clear inner knowing of next steps or right action in complex situations
- Capacity to discern authentic from inauthentic in self and others
- Growing alignment between understanding and action
- Development of consistent inner guidance that shapes life choices
- Increasing clarity about one's true nature and purpose
- Integration of moral insight with practical wisdom

[Functional Description]
This faculty develops through the interplay of experience, reflection, and conscious cultivation. Initially experienced as occasional moments of clarity or conviction, it gradually becomes a more stable presence through practices that refine self-awareness and moral sensitivity. Regular exercise of this faculty in daily choices strengthens it, while neglect or override weakens it. It can be clouded by strong emotions, fixed beliefs, or external pressures, but remains accessible through honest self-reflection and sincere desire for truth.

In practical terms, it operates as an internal reference point for authentic action and decision-making. Rather than replacing rational thought or emotional intelligence, it integrates and transcends them, providing a more comprehensive form of knowing. This guidance becomes particularly valuable in complex situations where rules or logic alone prove insufficient, offering clear direction that emerges from a deeper understanding of reality and human nature.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural? Yes - describes universal human faculty
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while making accessible
3. Practical? Yes - clear applications to decision-making and development
4. Individual/Universal connection? Yes - bridges personal faculty with universal truth
5. Development clear? Yes - describes both immediate function and growth process
6. Observable? Yes - manifestations are concrete and verifiable

Would you like me to revise any particular aspect of this reformulation?
