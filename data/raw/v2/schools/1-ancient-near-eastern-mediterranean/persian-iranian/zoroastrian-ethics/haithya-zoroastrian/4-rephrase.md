Let me follow the analytical process step by step:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Truth-alignment between inner reality and outer expression
Key functions:
- Personal integrity maintenance
- Reality-congruent communication
- Action-belief consistency
- Trust-building
- Order maintenance

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Inner sense of truthfulness
- Congruence/incongruence awareness
- Trust building/breaking
- Integrity challenges
- Authenticity struggles

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Truth-alignment capacity
- Integrity maintenance function
- Trust-building mechanism
- Order-preserving role

Here's the universalized description following the requested format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain conscious alignment between inner truth and outer expression, manifesting as a state of personal integrity where thoughts, words, and actions form a consistent whole. This quality enables authentic living while contributing to the maintenance of trust and order in human relationships and social systems.

[Essential Nature]
Truth-alignment represents a fundamental human capacity for maintaining congruence between internal reality and external expression. It operates as an active force for coherence, continuously reconciling our inner world of thoughts, feelings, and knowledge with our outer world of speech and action. This quality serves both individual development through authentic self-expression and collective harmony through reliable interaction patterns.

Unlike simple truthfulness or honesty, truth-alignment encompasses the entire spectrum of human expression, serving as an integrating force that brings clarity, consistency, and reliability to human experience and interaction. It manifests as a dynamic balance between self-awareness, expressive accuracy, and responsible action.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent alignment between stated principles and observable actions
- Clear and accurate communication that reflects genuine understanding
- Natural congruence between facial expressions, body language, and verbal content
- Reliable follow-through on commitments and declarations
- Spontaneous correction of misalignments when recognized
- Progressive development of deeper self-awareness and expressive precision
- Building and maintaining trust through predictable integrity

[Functional Description]
Truth-alignment operates through a continuous process of internal monitoring and external calibration. This quality acts as an internal compass that detects discrepancies between knowledge, expression, and action, triggering adjustments to maintain coherence. It functions both consciously through deliberate choices and unconsciously through developed habits of integrity, creating a self-reinforcing pattern of authentic living.

In practical terms, this quality manifests as a natural tendency toward accurate self-expression and reliable behavior patterns. It enables clear communication, builds stable relationships, and contributes to social trust through consistent demonstration of integrity. The presence of this quality creates an atmosphere of reliability and authenticity that supports both personal development and social cohesion.
