Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF MITHRA:
Core principle: Mutual trust and obligation binding parties together
Key functions: 
- Creates stable social bonds
- Maintains order through reciprocal commitment
- Establishes framework for cooperation
- Validates agreements and promises
Systemic role: Creates reliable social/economic infrastructure

2. UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Promise-making/keeping
- Trust in relationships
- Mutual dependence
- Social contracts
- Reciprocal obligations

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary elements:
- Trust-building capacity
- Commitment fulfillment
- Reciprocal responsibility
- Social cohesion foundation

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to create and maintain bonds of mutual trust through faithful commitment to agreements, promises, and obligations. It manifests as the reliable force that transforms mere arrangements into meaningful covenants, building the foundation for sustainable relationships and cooperative endeavors.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the human capacity to extend ourselves beyond the present moment through trustworthy commitment, creating stable bridges between individuals and groups. It operates as both an internal compass for honorable conduct and an external force that weaves the fabric of social trust. More than simple promise-keeping, it embodies the deep understanding that human flourishing depends on our ability to create reliable bonds of mutual obligation and faithfully maintain them through time.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent fulfillment of promises and agreements
- Natural trustworthiness in relationships and dealings
- Recognition and honoring of implicit social contracts
- Careful attention to commitments before making them
- Active maintenance of cooperative relationships
- Building and preserving reputation for reliability
- Creating conditions for sustainable collaboration

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive recognition of interdependence and the power of reliable commitment. It begins with simple promise-keeping and grows into a sophisticated understanding of social contracts and mutual obligations. As it matures, it transforms from a rule-based approach to promise-keeping into an internal compass that naturally guides behavior toward trustworthiness and responsibility.

In practice, it manifests as the foundation for all sustainable cooperation and meaningful relationship-building. It creates the conditions for complex social organization by establishing reliable patterns of mutual trust and reciprocal obligation. This quality enables individuals and groups to extend their effective reach through time and space by creating stable networks of reliable relationships and agreements.
