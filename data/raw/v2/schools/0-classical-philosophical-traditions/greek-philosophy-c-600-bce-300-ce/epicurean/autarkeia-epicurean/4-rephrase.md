Let me follow the process step by step for Autarkeia.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Self-sufficient contentment through wise limitation
Key functions:
- Liberation from unnecessary dependencies
- Creation of stable satisfaction
- Development of internal resources
- Protection from external volatility

Systemic role:
- Supports emotional stability
- Enables sustainable happiness
- Reduces vulnerability
- Promotes resilience

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Need vs. want discrimination
- Finding "enough"
- Internal resource development
- Sustainable contentment

Contemporary parallels:
- Minimalism
- Financial independence
- Emotional self-regulation
- Sustainable living

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary pattern: Development of sustainable self-sufficiency through wise limitation and internal resource cultivation

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to achieve stable contentment through wise self-limitation and internal resource development, resulting in genuine independence from unnecessary external dependencies while maintaining healthy interdependence for essential needs.

[Essential Nature]
Self-sufficiency represents the human capacity to develop sustainable contentment through the cultivation of internal resources and the wise discrimination between authentic needs and superfluous wants. It operates through two complementary processes: the conscious limitation of external dependencies to genuine necessities, and the development of internal capabilities that enable stable satisfaction regardless of circumstance.

This quality manifests as a dynamic balance between independence and interconnection, where personal sovereignty emerges not through isolation, but through the wisdom to distinguish between healthy interdependence and unnecessary dependency.

[Manifestations]
- Clear discrimination between authentic needs and conditioned wants
- Stable satisfaction independent of external circumstances
- Resilient contentment based on internal resources
- Wise cultivation and management of essential relationships
- Skillful navigation of abundance without developing dependencies
- Capacity to find sufficiency in simple circumstances
- Natural gravitation toward sustainable choices and patterns

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of our relationship with both internal and external resources. It begins with conscious observation of what truly generates sustainable satisfaction versus temporary pleasure, leading to increasingly refined discrimination between authentic needs and habitual wants. This understanding naturally evolves into a preference for choices that maintain independence while honoring healthy interdependence.

In practical application, it manifests as an elegant simplicity in lifestyle choices, characterized by neither excess nor deprivation. The person expressing this quality naturally gravitates toward sustainable patterns of living, finding deep satisfaction in having "enough" while maintaining the resilience to adapt to changing circumstances. This creates a foundation of stable contentment that remains unshaken by external volatility while supporting genuine connection and contribution to community well-being.
