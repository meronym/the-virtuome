Let me follow the process systematically for Ataraxia:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Inner peace independent of external circumstances
Key functions:
- Freedom from unnecessary disturbance
- Mental equilibrium maintenance
- Emotional resilience
- Clear perception of reality
Systemic role: Both goal state and operational quality

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Seeking peace of mind
- Managing anxiety/worry
- Dealing with uncertainty
- Finding stable happiness
Contemporary parallels:
- Stress management
- Emotional regulation
- Mindfulness
- Psychological resilience

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary:
- State of undisturbed clarity
- Progressive development of stability
- Self-reinforcing quality
Secondary:
- Common obstacles: attachment, fear, confusion
- Supporting conditions: understanding, practice, wisdom
- Related: clarity, equilibrium, presence

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of profound inner stability and mental peace that arises from clear understanding and freedom from unnecessary disturbance. It represents the mind's natural state when freed from compulsive reactivity, baseless fears, and excessive attachments, enabling direct and undistorted engagement with reality.

[Essential Nature]
Inner peace is not merely the absence of disturbance but an active quality of clear, stable presence. Like a deep ocean undisturbed by surface waves, it represents the mind's capacity to maintain equilibrium amid changing circumstances. This quality combines clear seeing with emotional stability, creating a self-reinforcing state where understanding deepens peace, and peace enables clearer understanding.

The development of this quality transforms our relationship with experience from reactive to responsive, from fragile to resilient, from dependent to self-sustaining. It manifests as both a progressive skill and a natural state, becoming more stable and accessible through understanding and practice.

[Manifestations]
- Maintained equilibrium during challenging circumstances
- Clear perception unclouded by emotional reactivity
- Natural joy and contentment independent of external conditions
- Responsive rather than reactive engagement with life
- Resilient stability during change and uncertainty
- Freedom from compulsive worry about past or future
- Authentic presence in current experience

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through the progressive clarification of perception and stabilization of awareness. As understanding deepens, reactive patterns naturally unwind, revealing an inherent stability of mind. This process is supported by direct recognition of unnecessary mental activity and the development of natural contentment. Like learning to find one's balance, initial effort gives way to effortless maintenance.

In daily life, this manifests as decreased reactivity to stressors, clearer decision-making, and more authentic relationships. Rather than suppressing or avoiding difficult experiences, one develops the capacity to remain present and responsive. This creates a positive feedback loop where stable presence enables better understanding, which in turn deepens stability, leading to sustainable well-being and clarity.
```

This universalization:
1. Maintains the depth of the original Epicurean concept
2. Makes it accessible through common experiences
3. Emphasizes observable manifestations
4. Provides clear developmental trajectory
5. Shows practical relevance
6. Connects individual experience to universal patterns

The description avoids culture-specific references while preserving the sophisticated understanding of how this quality operates and develops. It connects to contemporary concerns about stress, anxiety, and sustainable well-being while maintaining the philosophical depth of the original concept.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the objectives?
