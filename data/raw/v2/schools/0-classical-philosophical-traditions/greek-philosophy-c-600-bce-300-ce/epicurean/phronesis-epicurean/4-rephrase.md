Let me work through this systematically for Phronēsis.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Practical wisdom that guides good judgment and decision-making
Key functions: 
- Evaluation of choices and consequences
- Integration of experience and principle
- Navigation of complexity
- Balancing competing demands

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Making difficult decisions
- Learning from experience
- Developing good judgment
- Balancing short/long-term considerations

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to make wise decisions through deep understanding of situations, clear judgment of consequences, and integration of experience with principle. It combines practical insight with reasoned analysis to navigate life's complexity while maintaining alignment with what truly matters.

[Essential Nature]
Practical wisdom represents the matured ability to perceive what is truly important in any situation and respond appropriately. It goes beyond both abstract knowledge and mere experience, emerging as a refined capacity to recognize patterns, anticipate consequences, and identify the most beneficial course of action. This quality integrates intellectual understanding with experiential learning, emotional intelligence with rational analysis, and immediate awareness with long-term perspective.

[Manifestations]
- Clear discernment between essential and superficial aspects of situations
- Balanced consideration of immediate needs and longer-term implications
- Natural recognition of what's truly important in complex situations
- Ability to learn deeply from experience and apply insights appropriately
- Integration of multiple perspectives and factors in decision-making
- Consistent alignment between decisions and fundamental values
- Capacity to adapt principles to specific contexts without compromising their essence

[Functional Description]
Practical wisdom develops through an iterative process of experience, reflection, and integration. Each significant decision or experience becomes an opportunity for deeper understanding, while accumulated insights form increasingly refined mental models for navigating similar situations. This quality grows through conscious engagement with challenging situations, honest examination of outcomes, and continuous refinement of judgment.

In daily life, it manifests as a natural clarity about what matters in any given situation. Rather than getting lost in unnecessary complexity or oversimplifying important matters, one maintains a clear sense of priority and proportion. This enables consistently good judgment that benefits both oneself and others, while building lasting capability for handling increasingly complex challenges.

This universalized description preserves key aspects of Epicurean phronēsis while making it accessible across cultural contexts:

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Centers on universal human experiences of decision-making and wisdom
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding of wisdom's development
3. Practical applicability: Clear connection to daily decisions and life navigation
4. Individual-universal connection: Links personal development to universal patterns
5. Developmental clarity: Describes how this quality grows through experience
6. Observable manifestations: Focuses on concrete expressions and behaviors

The description maintains philosophical sophistication while grounding it in experiential reality, making it both profound and practical. It preserves the Epicurean emphasis on practical judgment while expanding its relevance beyond its original cultural context.

Should I refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
