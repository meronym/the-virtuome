[Core Definition]
The capacity for direct, unmediated perception and understanding, characterized by the ability to distinguish between clear evidence and mere opinion or assumption. It enables one to see reality as it is, free from distorting beliefs, leading to reliable knowledge and sound judgment.

[Essential Nature]
Cognitive clarity manifests as a distinct quality of mind where perception and understanding become sharp, direct, and trustworthy. It's the difference between knowing something through clear evidence versus accepting it through assumption or hearsay. This quality combines acute observation with the ability to recognize when we actually know something versus when we're filling in gaps with beliefs or assumptions.

This clarity operates on both sensory and intellectual levels, creating a foundation for reliable understanding and wise action. It develops through consistent practice of distinguishing between direct evidence and interpretation, gradually refining our ability to perceive and understand clearly.

[Manifestations]
- Immediate recognition of the difference between what we observe and what we assume
- Capacity to suspend interpretation and see phenomena directly
- Natural skepticism toward claims without clear evidence
- Ability to identify and question one's own assumptions
- Recognition of the limits of one's knowledge
- Preference for direct verification over accepted authority
- Clear discrimination between facts and opinions in decision-making

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through repeated practice of returning to direct observation and evidence, gradually building confidence in distinguishing between clear knowledge and mere opinion. It begins with simple sensory observations and extends to more complex understanding, always maintaining connection with verifiable evidence. The process involves both learning to see clearly and unlearning the habit of filling gaps with assumptions.

In practical application, this quality enables better decision-making through reduced cognitive distortion, more accurate assessment of situations, and greater resistance to misinformation. It supports both intellectual and practical wisdom by providing a reliable foundation for understanding and action. This clarity becomes particularly valuable in complex situations where distinguishing fact from assumption is crucial for effective response.
