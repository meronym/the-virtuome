[Core Definition]
The natural human capacity for deep engagement with learning and understanding, expressed through sustained curiosity, systematic investigation, and integration of knowledge. It manifests as an active love for discovery that transforms both the learner and their understanding of reality.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the evolved human capacity to not merely acquire information, but to engage deeply with understanding itself. It combines natural curiosity with disciplined inquiry, moving beyond simple fact-gathering to profound comprehension. At its core, it's the drive that turns experience into wisdom through active engagement with knowledge.

Unlike mere curiosity or academic study, this quality encompasses the full spectrum of human learning capacity - from sensory observation through analytical understanding to wisdom integration. It operates as both an orientation toward experience and a systematic approach to understanding, continuously transforming both knowledge and knower.

[Manifestations]
- Sustained engagement with topics of investigation
- Systematic approach to understanding new areas
- Integration of knowledge across domains
- Regular reflection on and revision of understanding
- Teaching and sharing insights with others
- Development of increasingly sophisticated learning methods
- Application of insights to new situations

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive stages, beginning with natural curiosity and evolving through structured investigation to integrated wisdom. It operates by maintaining active engagement with both the process and content of learning, creating feedback loops that deepen understanding while developing more sophisticated learning capabilities. The quality becomes self-reinforcing as greater understanding reveals new areas for investigation and improved methods for learning.

In practical terms, it manifests as sustained engagement with topics of interest, systematic approaches to investigation, and regular integration of new knowledge into existing understanding. It leads to both expanded knowledge and enhanced learning capacity, expressing itself through improved ability to understand complex systems, recognize patterns, and apply insights across domains. This quality transforms both what we know and how we learn.
