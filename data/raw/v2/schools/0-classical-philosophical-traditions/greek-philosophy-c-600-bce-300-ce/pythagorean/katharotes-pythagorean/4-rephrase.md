Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Katharotes:
Core principle: Progressive refinement/clarification of being
Functions: Removal of obstacles, cultivation of clarity, enhancement of perception
Systemic role: Foundational enabler for higher development
Developmental: Moves from gross to subtle, external to internal

2. UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences: 
- Sensation of mental clarity vs. confusion
- Experience of unburdening/lightening
- Moments of pristine awareness
- Recognition of interference patterns

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary: Clarity/refinement process
Secondary: Progressive development from external to internal purification

Here's the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of progressive refinement through which a person cultivates increasing clarity of perception, understanding, and being. It operates through the systematic identification and release of interfering elements—whether physical, mental, or emotional—leading to enhanced awareness and more direct engagement with reality.

[Essential Nature]
Clarity is a fundamental capacity of human consciousness that can be deliberately cultivated. It manifests as a self-reinforcing process of refinement: as interference decreases, perception becomes more acute, allowing for the recognition of increasingly subtle forms of obstruction. This creates an upward spiral of development where each level of clarity enables new depths of understanding and capability.

This quality operates across multiple dimensions simultaneously—physical, emotional, mental, and perceptual—with progress in each domain supporting the others. Like cleaning a lens, it doesn't add anything new but rather reveals what was already present by removing what obscures it.

[Manifestations]
- Physical: Increased sensory acuity, efficient movement, natural regulation of consumption
- Mental: Reduced thought noise, enhanced focus, clearer perception of reality
- Emotional: Greater equilibrium, reduced reactivity, increased sensitivity
- Behavioral: Simplified patterns, reduced waste/excess, enhanced discrimination
- Environmental: Organization of space, elimination of clutter, optimization of conditions
- Relational: Clear communication, reduced projection, authentic presence
- Developmental: Progressive refinement from gross to subtle awareness

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a dual process of elimination and refinement. The elimination aspect involves identifying and releasing whatever obscures natural clarity—whether physical toxins, mental constructs, emotional patterns, or perceptual habits. The refinement aspect cultivates increasingly subtle discrimination and awareness, allowing for the recognition and release of progressively finer layers of interference.

In practical application, this manifests as a systematic approach to simplification and optimization across all life domains. It begins with obvious physical aspects like diet, environment, and routine, then progresses to subtler dimensions like thought patterns, emotional responses, and perceptual frameworks. The result is enhanced functionality, increased energy efficiency, and clearer access to direct experience of reality.

This reformulation:
1. Preserves the core Pythagorean insight about progressive refinement
2. Makes it accessible without requiring philosophical background
3. Maintains practical applicability
4. Links individual practice to universal principles
5. Outlines clear developmental trajectory
6. Provides observable markers of progress

The description passes the verification questions by:
1. Using universal human experiences of clarity/interference
2. Maintaining the depth of systematic development
3. Offering clear practical applications
4. Connecting personal practice to universal principles
5. Outlining progressive development
6. Providing concrete manifestations

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this reformulation?
