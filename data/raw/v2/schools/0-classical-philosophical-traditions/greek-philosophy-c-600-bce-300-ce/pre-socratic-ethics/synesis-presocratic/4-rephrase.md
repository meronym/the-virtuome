Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Synesis:
Core principle: Active, penetrating understanding that unifies experience
Key functions: Integration of perception, insight generation, pattern recognition
Relationship patterns: Links particular to universal, theory to practice
Developmental aspects: Grows through attention, reflection, and integration

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- "Aha!" moments of insight
- Pattern recognition across domains
- Deep comprehension beyond facts
- Intuitive grasp of whole situations

STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Primary essence: Living understanding that connects and illuminates
Key manifestations: Pattern recognition, insight, holistic awareness
Developmental path: From fragmented to unified understanding
Systemic role: Integrates experience into coherent whole

Here's my attempt at the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for living understanding that penetrates beyond surface knowledge to grasp the interconnected nature of reality. It manifests as an active, dynamic comprehension that unifies experience, recognizes patterns, and generates genuine insight through direct engagement with life's phenomena.

[Essential Nature]
Living understanding differs fundamentally from accumulated knowledge or abstract reasoning. It represents the mind's natural capacity to recognize patterns, make meaningful connections, and grasp the essence of situations directly. This quality combines alertness, receptivity, and integrative power to transform raw experience into genuine insight.

This understanding is inherently active and participatory, engaging with reality rather than merely observing it. It develops through sustained attention, reflection, and the progressive integration of experience into coherent wholes, leading to ever-deeper levels of comprehension and practical wisdom.

[Manifestations]
- Immediate grasp of situation essentials without lengthy analysis
- Recognition of meaningful patterns across seemingly disparate domains
- Integration of new experiences into coherent understanding
- Generation of fresh insights through direct engagement
- Natural movement between parts and wholes
- Capacity to share understanding in ways others can grasp
- Development of increasingly subtle pattern recognition

[Functional Description]
Living understanding operates through a dynamic interplay of attention, integration, and insight. It begins with open, alert receptivity to direct experience, progresses through recognition of patterns and relationships, and culminates in coherent comprehension that encompasses both details and wholeness. This process continuously refines itself, developing greater subtlety and depth through engaged practice.

In daily life, this quality enables rapid grasp of situations, effective response to novel challenges, and growing wisdom through experience. It manifests as the ability to see through complexity to essential patterns, to learn deeply from experience, and to share understanding in ways that illuminate rather than merely inform. This understanding naturally bridges theory and practice, thought and action, individual and universal.
```

This universalization aims to:
1. Capture the active, living nature of synesis
2. Express it in experiential rather than theoretical terms
3. Connect it to universal human capacities
4. Maintain its sophistication while increasing accessibility
5. Preserve its developmental aspects
6. Link individual experience to universal patterns

The description emphasizes:
- Active vs passive understanding
- Integration vs mere accumulation
- Direct insight vs abstract knowledge
- Practical wisdom vs theoretical knowledge
- Progressive development vs static state

Would you like me to adjust any aspects to better meet the objectives?
