HISTORICAL CONTEXT\n- Pre-Socratics marked the transition from mythological to philosophical ethics\n- They maintained connections to both religious/mystical and rational/philosophical approaches\n- Their focus was primarily cosmological, but with strong ethical implications\n\n2. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES\n- Unity of cosmic and human order\n- Emphasis on wisdom through understanding nature\n- Balance between practical and theoretical wisdom\n- Integration of physical and ethical principles\n\n3. SELECTION CRITERIA:\na) Historical significance\n- Must be well-attested in reliable sources\n- Should show clear Pre-Socratic distinctiveness\n\nb) Philosophical importance\n- Central to Pre-Socratic ethical thought\n- Connected to their broader philosophical systems\n\nc) Developmental significance\n- Influenced later Greek philosophy\n- Bridged earlier religious and later philosophical ethics\n\nd) Practical application\n- Had clear behavioral implications\n- Connected theory with practice\n\n4. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Should include both intellectual and practical virtues\n- Need to represent both individual and communal aspects\n- Must reflect both contemplative and active dimensions\n- Should capture both universal and particular aspects\n\nBased on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of core Pre-Socratic virtues:\n\n1.
