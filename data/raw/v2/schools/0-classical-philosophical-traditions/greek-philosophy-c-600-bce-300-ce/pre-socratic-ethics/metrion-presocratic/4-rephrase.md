Let me follow the process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Right measure/proportion as a fundamental ordering principle
Functions: 
- Guides appropriate action
- Balances extremes
- Creates sustainable patterns
- Enables harmony
- Supports wisdom

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Finding balance in daily choices
- Sensing when something is "just right"
- Recognizing excess/deficiency
- Natural rhythms and cycles
- Sustainable vs. unsustainable patterns

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Balance-seeking capacity
- Natural ordering principle
- Self-regulating wisdom
- Sustainable harmony

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The innate capacity to recognize, establish, and maintain appropriate proportion in all dimensions of life. It manifests as the ability to find and hold the optimal point between excess and deficiency, guided by an intuitive sense of rightness and sustainable balance.

[Essential Nature]
Measure operates as a fundamental ordering principle in human experience, expressing itself through our natural ability to sense when something is "just right" versus too much or too little. It's not merely moderation, but rather the dynamic capacity to find the optimal point that creates sustainable harmony in any given context. This quality combines intuitive wisdom with practical judgment, allowing us to align our actions with natural patterns of balance and proportion.

[Manifestations]
- An intuitive sense of "enough" in resource use, effort, or expression
- Natural calibration of energy, emotion, and engagement to context
- Recognition of sustainable versus unsustainable patterns
- Ability to find and maintain balanced states
- Spontaneous correction of excess or deficiency
- Harmonious rhythm in activity and rest
- Creation of proportionate responses to situations

[Functional Description]
This quality functions through a continuous process of dynamic calibration, integrating feedback from multiple levels of experience - physical, emotional, mental, and situational. Like a skilled musician finding perfect pitch, or a chef seasoning to taste, it operates through refined sensitivity combined with practical adjustment. The process becomes increasingly subtle and sophisticated with development, moving from conscious calculation to intuitive wisdom.

In daily life, it expresses as the capacity to naturally find appropriate boundaries, effort levels, and responses without rigid rules or external measures. It enables sustainable relationship with resources, energy, and time, creating patterns that can be maintained without strain or depletion. This quality supports both individual wellbeing and collective harmony through its ordering and balancing function.
```

This universalization maintains the sophisticated understanding of measure/proportion from Pre-Socratic thought while making it accessible through universal human experiences of balance, rhythm, and "rightness." It preserves the connection to cosmic order while grounding it in practical, observable manifestations.

The description emphasizes:
- Experiential rather than theoretical understanding
- Universal patterns observable across cultures
- Practical applications in daily life
- Development from conscious practice to intuitive wisdom
- Connection between individual and universal aspects

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
