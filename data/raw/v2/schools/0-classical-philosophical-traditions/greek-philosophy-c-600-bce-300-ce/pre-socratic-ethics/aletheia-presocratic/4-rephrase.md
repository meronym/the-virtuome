Let me follow the process systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Unconcealment/disclosure of reality
Functions: 
- Revelation of genuine nature
- Dispelling of illusion/confusion
- Alignment with reality
- Authentication of understanding
Systemic role: Foundation for wisdom and right action

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Moment of sudden clarity/insight
- Recognition of deeper patterns
- Discovery of authentic self
- Confrontation with reality
- Dissolution of misconceptions

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary elements:
- Revealing function
- Clarity-bringing quality
- Reality-aligning process
- Truth-seeking orientation

Based on this analysis, here's the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The natural capacity to recognize and align with reality as it truly is, manifesting as both an active process of discovery and a receptive state of clarity. This quality enables direct recognition of what is genuine and fundamental, beyond appearances, assumptions, or conventional understanding.

[Essential Nature]
Reality-recognition operates as a fundamental human capacity that functions both actively and receptively. As an active force, it drives us to seek genuine understanding and pierce through layers of assumption and misconception. As a receptive quality, it allows reality to reveal itself to us when we are properly attuned and present.

This quality exists as a continuous interplay between revealing and receiving, where our sincere effort to understand meets reality's natural tendency to disclose itself. It manifests both as sudden moments of clarity and as a gradual deepening of authentic understanding.

[Manifestations]
- Moments of direct insight where reality becomes suddenly clear
- Growing capacity to distinguish genuine from artificial
- Natural alertness to inconsistencies and hidden patterns
- Increased resonance with what is authentic and fundamental
- Progressive dissolution of misconceptions and false assumptions
- Development of clarity in perception and understanding
- Embodied knowing that precedes conceptual understanding

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dual process of active investigation and receptive awareness. It begins with an initial recognition that things might not be as they appear, developing through careful attention to direct experience rather than assumed knowledge. As it matures, it creates an increasingly refined capacity to recognize and align with what is genuine and fundamental in any situation. This process involves both breaking through existing misconceptions and developing new ways of seeing and understanding.

In practical terms, this quality manifests as an increasing ability to see situations clearly, make decisions based on reality rather than assumption, and maintain authentic relationships with self and others. It supports all other aspects of human development by providing a foundation of genuine understanding and authentic engagement with life. As it develops, it naturally leads to more authentic ways of living and relating, characterized by directness, honesty, and deep recognition of what is real and true.

This universal reformulation:
1. Preserves the original Greek concept's depth of meaning
2. Makes it accessible through common human experience
3. Maintains philosophical sophistication
4. Provides practical applications
5. Shows clear developmental trajectory
6. Links individual experience to universal principles

The description should be meaningful across cultures while maintaining the essential power of the original concept. It emphasizes the experiential aspects while preserving the philosophical depth.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this reformulation?
