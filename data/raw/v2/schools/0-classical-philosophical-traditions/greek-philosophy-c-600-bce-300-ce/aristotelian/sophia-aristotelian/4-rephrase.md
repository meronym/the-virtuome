Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Sophia:
Core principle: Integration of deep understanding with fundamental principles
Functions: Contemplative excellence, systematic comprehension, insight into reality
Systemic role: Highest intellectual achievement, guide for other forms of knowledge
Developmental aspects: Progressive deepening of understanding, integration of knowledge

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Quest for deep understanding
- Pattern recognition across domains
- Moments of profound insight
- Integration of knowledge and experience

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Systematic understanding
- Pattern recognition
- Integrative insight
- Contemplative depth

Secondary:
- Knowledge fragmentation (obstacle)
- Contemplative practice (condition)
- Intellectual humility (related)
- Teaching/mentoring (application)

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to perceive, understand, and integrate fundamental patterns of reality, combining deep systematic knowledge with intuitive insight into first principles. This quality enables one to grasp both the interconnected nature of things and their essential characteristics, leading to wisdom that transcends mere accumulation of facts.

[Essential Nature]
Integrative understanding represents the human capacity to comprehend reality at its deepest levels, moving beyond fragmentary knowledge to grasp fundamental principles and their interconnections. It manifests as the ability to recognize essential patterns across different domains of experience and knowledge, combining analytical precision with intuitive insight. This quality develops through the progressive integration of experience, knowledge, and contemplative insight, leading to a comprehensive understanding that illuminates both universal principles and particular situations.

[Manifestations]
- Recognition of fundamental patterns across seemingly disparate domains
- Ability to move fluidly between particular cases and universal principles
- Integration of theoretical knowledge with practical insight
- Capacity to identify core principles underlying complex phenomena
- Development of contemplative insight alongside systematic understanding
- Teaching ability that makes profound insights accessible to others
- Balance of intellectual humility with confident understanding

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay between systematic analysis and intuitive insight. It develops through cycles of learning, reflection, and integration, where new information and experiences are continuously woven into an expanding framework of understanding. The process involves both active investigation and receptive contemplation, allowing deeper patterns and principles to emerge into conscious awareness.

In practical terms, this understanding manifests as the ability to navigate complexity with clarity, to recognize essential factors in any situation, and to communicate profound insights in accessible ways. It enables one to contribute meaningfully to human knowledge and understanding, while maintaining the humility that comes from recognizing the vastness of what remains unknown. This quality serves as a bridge between theoretical knowledge and practical wisdom, enriching both individual understanding and collective human knowledge.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural? Yes - focuses on universal human capacity for understanding
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophistication while increasing accessibility
3. Practically applicable? Yes - links theoretical understanding to practical manifestation
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - connects personal development to universal understanding
5. Development clear? Yes - describes progressive integration and growth
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - listed concrete expressions and applications

This universalized description maintains the essential depth of Aristotle's sophia while making it accessible and relevant to contemporary experience across cultures. It preserves the philosophical sophistication while grounding it in observable phenomena and practical applications.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this description to better meet the objectives?
