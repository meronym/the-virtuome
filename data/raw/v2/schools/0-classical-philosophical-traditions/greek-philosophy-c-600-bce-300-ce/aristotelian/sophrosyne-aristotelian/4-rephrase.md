Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to engage with life's pleasures and desires in a way that promotes lasting well-being and inner harmony. It manifests as neither suppression nor indulgence, but rather as the skilled integration of enjoyment with wisdom, allowing for sustainable flourishing through balanced engagement with life's offerings.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the sophisticated human capacity to find optimal relationship with pleasure and desire. Unlike simple restraint or denial, it involves developing a refined sensitivity to what truly nourishes versus what merely stimulates. It enables us to fully enjoy life's offerings while maintaining inner stability and long-term well-being.

At its core, it's about discovering how different forms of engagement affect our overall state and learning to naturally gravitate toward those that promote sustainable flourishing. This involves both the wisdom to discern and the capacity to implement balanced choices in daily life.

[Manifestations]
- Natural preference for sustainable pleasures over harmful indulgences
- Smooth regulation of impulses without rigid control
- Clarity about what truly nourishes versus merely stimulates
- Ability to fully enjoy without becoming dependent
- Stable positive mood independent of external stimulation
- Capacity to maintain balance amid temptation
- Natural gravitation toward healthy rhythms of engagement

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of our relationship with pleasure and desire. It begins with basic impulse regulation but evolves into an intuitive wisdom about sustainable engagement. The process involves learning through experience how different choices affect our state, gradually building an embodied understanding of what promotes lasting well-being versus temporary satisfaction.

In practical terms, it manifests as a natural preference for choices that support overall flourishing. Rather than constant self-control, it becomes an effortless navigation toward balanced engagement. This enables both full enjoyment of life's pleasures and maintained inner stability, creating a sustainable foundation for all other aspects of personal development.
