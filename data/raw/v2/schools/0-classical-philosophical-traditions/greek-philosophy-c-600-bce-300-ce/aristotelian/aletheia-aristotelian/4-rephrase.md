Let me follow the analytical process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Truth-alignment in being and action
Functions: 
- Self-knowledge facilitation
- Reality-correspondence
- Authentic self-expression
- Knowledge verification
- Trust-building

Systemic roles:
- Foundation for wisdom
- Basis for genuine relationships
- Prerequisite for learning
- Essential for ethical judgment

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING
Universal experiences:
- Recognition of truth/falsity
- Desire for authentic expression
- Need for reliable knowledge
- Experience of congruence/incongruence
- Search for understanding

3. STRUCTURAL INTEGRATION
Primary patterns:
- Internal-external alignment
- Recognition-expression dynamic
- Knowledge-action correspondence
- Self-other authenticity

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for living in alignment with reality, manifesting as the consistent recognition, embodiment, and expression of truth in understanding, speech, and action. It encompasses both the clear perception of what is and the authentic presentation of oneself and one's understanding to others.

[Essential Nature]
Truth-alignment operates as a dynamic integration of perception, understanding, and expression. It begins with the careful recognition of reality as it is, develops through the internal cultivation of clear understanding, and manifests in authentic self-expression and accurate communication. This quality serves as a bridge between inner experience and outer reality, enabling both personal integrity and meaningful connection with others.

More than mere factual accuracy, it represents a fundamental orientation toward reality that encompasses intellectual honesty, emotional authenticity, and behavioral consistency. It requires constant calibration between internal understanding and external reality, between self-knowledge and self-expression, between what we know and how we live.

[Manifestations]
- Clear recognition of reality without distortion or denial
- Accurate self-knowledge and honest self-assessment
- Congruence between internal understanding and external expression
- Faithful representation of knowledge and experience in communication
- Consistent alignment between beliefs, words, and actions
- Recognition and acknowledgment of uncertainty or ignorance
- Active engagement in truth-seeking and verification

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through an iterative process of reality-testing, self-examination, and authentic expression. It begins with careful observation and verification of truth in specific instances, gradually building toward a more comprehensive capacity for truth-recognition and truth-telling. The development requires both courage to face uncomfortable truths and humility to acknowledge the limits of one's understanding. Regular practice in both private reflection and public expression strengthens this capacity.

In practical terms, truth-alignment manifests as intellectual honesty in learning, emotional authenticity in relationships, and behavioral integrity in action. It enables clear thinking, fosters trust in relationships, and builds reliable knowledge. This quality serves as a foundation for wisdom, supporting both personal development and collective understanding through the consistent recognition and communication of truth.

This universalized description:
- Preserves the depth of Aristotelian alÄ“theia
- Makes it accessible across cultures
- Maintains practical applicability
- Connects individual and universal dimensions
- Outlines clear developmental pathways
- Provides observable manifestations
- Retains philosophical sophistication while using experiential language

The description passes the verification questions by:
1. Using universal human experiences of truth and authenticity
2. Maintaining the complexity of the original concept
3. Providing clear practical applications
4. Connecting personal truth-alignment to universal truth
5. Outlining developmental progression
6. Listing observable manifestations

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the objectives?
