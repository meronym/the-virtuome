[Core Definition]
The capacity for living in alignment with reality, manifesting as the consistent recognition, embodiment, and expression of truth in understanding, speech, and action. It encompasses both the clear perception of what is and the authentic presentation of oneself and one's understanding to others.

[Essential Nature]
Truth-alignment operates as a dynamic integration of perception, understanding, and expression. It begins with the careful recognition of reality as it is, develops through the internal cultivation of clear understanding, and manifests in authentic self-expression and accurate communication. This quality serves as a bridge between inner experience and outer reality, enabling both personal integrity and meaningful connection with others.

More than mere factual accuracy, it represents a fundamental orientation toward reality that encompasses intellectual honesty, emotional authenticity, and behavioral consistency. It requires constant calibration between internal understanding and external reality, between self-knowledge and self-expression, between what we know and how we live.

[Manifestations]
- Clear recognition of reality without distortion or denial
- Accurate self-knowledge and honest self-assessment
- Congruence between internal understanding and external expression
- Faithful representation of knowledge and experience in communication
- Consistent alignment between beliefs, words, and actions
- Recognition and acknowledgment of uncertainty or ignorance
- Active engagement in truth-seeking and verification

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through an iterative process of reality-testing, self-examination, and authentic expression. It begins with careful observation and verification of truth in specific instances, gradually building toward a more comprehensive capacity for truth-recognition and truth-telling. The development requires both courage to face uncomfortable truths and humility to acknowledge the limits of one's understanding. Regular practice in both private reflection and public expression strengthens this capacity.

In practical terms, truth-alignment manifests as intellectual honesty in learning, emotional authenticity in relationships, and behavioral integrity in action. It enables clear thinking, fosters trust in relationships, and builds reliable knowledge. This quality serves as a foundation for wisdom, supporting both personal development and collective understanding through the consistent recognition and communication of truth.
