Let me follow the analysis and transformation process for Andreia:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
- Core: Steadfast alignment with truth/good despite challenges
- Functions: Protection of values, enabling right action, sustaining conviction
- Systemic role: Bridges wisdom and action, enables other virtues
- Development: From physical to moral to philosophical courage

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
- Universal experiences: Facing fears, standing for principles, persisting through difficulty
- Parallel concepts: Moral strength, integrity, resilience, principled action
- Contemporary relevance: Moral courage, intellectual integrity, civil courage
- Timeless patterns: Challenge-response-growth cycle

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain alignment with truth and principle in the face of challenge or threat, enabling consistent expression of one's highest understanding despite external pressure or internal resistance. This quality bridges insight with action, enabling the manifestation of other virtues under adverse conditions.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the internal strength that allows beings to act in accordance with their deepest understanding despite forces pushing against such action. It operates at multiple levels - physical, emotional, moral, and intellectual - always expressing the same fundamental pattern: the maintenance of alignment with truth/good despite countervailing forces.

More than mere fearlessness or persistence, it embodies the dynamic tension between understanding what is right and the capacity to manifest that understanding in the face of opposition. It serves as both protector and enabler of other qualities, creating the conditions under which wisdom can express itself in action.

[Manifestations]
- Physical: Standing ground despite danger, protecting others, enduring hardship
- Emotional: Facing uncomfortable truths, expressing authentic feelings, remaining stable in turmoil
- Moral: Acting on principles despite social pressure, standing up for others, maintaining integrity
- Intellectual: Pursuing truth despite implications, questioning assumptions, holding uncertainty
- Spiritual: Maintaining faith through doubt, facing existential fears, pursuing transformation
- Social: Defending justice, confronting wrongdoing, supporting righteous causes
- Internal: Self-honesty, confronting personal shadows, maintaining disciplined practice

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive confrontation with and mastery of fear and resistance. Beginning with physical challenges, it evolves through emotional and social tensions to encompass moral and intellectual domains. Each level of mastery builds upon previous ones, creating an integrated capacity for principled action under pressure. The development process involves identifying true threats versus perceived ones, building internal resources, and learning to maintain clarity and stability in challenging situations.

In practice, this quality enables individuals to serve as stabilizing forces in their communities, capable of maintaining and defending truth and principle when expedience or fear might suggest otherwise. It creates the conditions for social progress by enabling individuals to stand for new understandings against established patterns, while simultaneously providing the stability necessary for sustainable development of both individuals and groups.

This universalized description:
- Preserves the depth of the Platonic concept
- Makes it accessible across cultures
- Maintains practical applicability
- Links individual to universal aspects
- Shows clear developmental trajectory
- Provides observable manifestations
- Retains philosophical sophistication while using experiential language

Would you like me to emphasize or elaborate on any particular aspect of this universalization?
