Let me work through this systematically for Diakrisis.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Refined discriminative awareness that operates across multiple domains
Functions: 
- Separates truth from appearance
- Guides practical wisdom
- Enables spiritual discernment
- Facilitates clear judgment
Systemic role: Bridge between theoretical understanding and practical application

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Moment of clarity in complex situations
- Recognition of authentic vs artificial
- Deep knowing beyond rational analysis
- Intuitive understanding of right action

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary:
- Clarity of perception
- Refined judgment
- Integration of intuition and reason
- Progressive refinement of discernment

Secondary:
- Mental noise and confusion
- Need for practice and development
- Relationship to wisdom and understanding
- Application in daily decisions

Now, formatted output:

[Core Definition]
The capacity for clear, refined discrimination that combines intellectual precision with intuitive insight, enabling one to discern truth from appearance, essential from peripheral, and appropriate from inappropriate across all domains of experience and action.

[Essential Nature]
Discriminative awareness represents a fundamental capacity of human consciousness to make fine distinctions and accurate assessments. It operates through an integration of analytical precision and intuitive understanding, developing through experience and conscious cultivation. This faculty goes beyond mere intellectual analysis, embodying a mature capacity for judgment that encompasses practical, ethical, and spiritual dimensions.

Unlike simple decision-making or rational analysis, this quality represents a refined perceptual ability that becomes increasingly subtle and comprehensive through development, eventually operating as an immediate knowing that precedes analytical thought while remaining precisely discriminative.

[Manifestations]
- Immediate recognition of truth versus falsehood in encounters and ideas
- Clear perception of appropriate action in complex situations
- Natural discrimination between authentic and inauthentic expressions
- Refined ability to separate essential from non-essential elements
- Spontaneous recognition of proper timing and proportion
- Integration of rational analysis with intuitive understanding
- Progressive refinement of judgment across all life domains

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive refinement of both intellectual and intuitive capacities, beginning with careful analytical thinking and evolving toward immediate discriminative awareness. It operates through a combination of accumulated experience, refined perception, and cultivated wisdom, manifesting as an increasingly subtle ability to discern truth and appropriateness across all situations.

In practical application, it manifests as clear judgment in daily decisions, refined ethical discernment in complex situations, and deep insight in matters of understanding and truth. This faculty enables one to navigate both practical challenges and subtle questions with precision and wisdom, while maintaining connection to both universal principles and specific contexts.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the sophisticated discriminative aspect of diakrisis
2. Makes it accessible through reference to common experiences
3. Maintains both practical and contemplative dimensions
4. Shows developmental progression
5. Connects individual capacity to universal wisdom
6. Provides clear markers for verification and development

The description emphasizes the experiential and practical aspects while preserving the depth of the original Neo-Platonic concept. It frames the quality in terms of universal human capacities while maintaining its sophistication.

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: ✓ (focuses on universal human capacities)
2. Depth preservation: ✓ (maintains sophisticated understanding)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear practical manifestations)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (links personal development to universal wisdom)
5. Developmental clarity: ✓ (shows progression from basic to refined)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (provides verifiable expressions)
