Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Kallos Theion:

Core Principle:
- The attractive and transformative power of transcendent beauty
- Functions as both manifestation and attractor
- Bridges form and formless, particular and universal

Key Functions:
1. Attraction toward higher reality
2. Harmonization of parts within wholes
3. Recognition of underlying unity
4. Transformation through aesthetic experience

Relationship Patterns:
- Connected to love (eros) as motivating force
- Linked to truth through form/order
- Related to goodness through perfection
- Bridges contemplative and active modes

Based on this analysis, here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The recognition and experience of profound beauty that reveals deeper reality and draws us toward greater wholeness. It manifests as the harmonic ordering principle in nature, art, thought, and action, serving as both revelation of and pathway to universal truth and goodness.

[Essential Nature]
Beauty in this deepest sense is not merely aesthetic pleasure but a fundamental property of reality that we can experience and align with. It operates as an organizing force that creates harmony from chaos, unity from multiplicity, and meaning from randomness. This quality of beauty acts through attraction rather than compulsion, drawing us naturally toward greater integration, refinement, and truth.

When genuinely encountered, it produces a characteristic combination of joy, recognition, and aspiration - we simultaneously experience delight in what is revealed, recognition of its truth, and desire to more fully realize or embody what we glimpse. This makes beauty a unique bridge between our current state and our highest potential.

[Manifestations]
- Recognition of profound patterns and meaningful order in nature and experience
- Spontaneous feelings of elevation and expansion when encountering genuine beauty
- Increased harmony and integration in thought, feeling, and action
- Natural attraction toward what is more whole, refined, and true
- Growing ability to perceive and create beauty in multiple domains
- Development of taste and discrimination regarding what is genuinely beautiful versus merely pleasant
- Transformation of desire from superficial attractions toward deeper appreciation

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a combination of revelation and attraction. When we encounter genuine beauty, it temporarily lifts us out of our limited perspective and reveals a more complete vision of reality. This experience creates a natural desire to maintain and deepen that expanded state, gradually refining our perception and increasing our capacity to recognize and respond to beauty in all its forms.

In practice, cultivating this quality involves both receptivity and active engagement. We learn to recognize and open ourselves to beauty's presence in nature, art, ideas, and human excellence while also working to manifest these qualities in our own understanding, character, and creative expression. This creates an upward spiral where increasing recognition of beauty leads to greater embodiment, which in turn enhances our capacity to perceive and create beauty.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural? Yes - based on universal human experience of beauty and order
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains transformative and metaphysical aspects while making them experiential
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear connections to perception, action, and development
4. Individual/Universal connection? Yes - links personal experience to universal principles
5. Development clear? Yes - describes progressive refinement and expansion
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - listed concrete expressions and effects

The description maintains the profound metaphysical insights of Neo-Platonism while making them accessible through universal human experiences of beauty, harmony, and transformation. It preserves the dynamic relationship between beauty as both manifestation of and path to higher reality, while expressing this in phenomenological rather than theoretical terms.
