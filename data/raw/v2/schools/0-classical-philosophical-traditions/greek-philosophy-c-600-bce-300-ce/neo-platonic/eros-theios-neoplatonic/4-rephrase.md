Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Er≈çs Theios:
Core principle: Transformative spiritual attraction/aspiration
Key functions: 
- Motivating force for development
- Transmutation of desire
- Upward orientation of consciousness
- Unifying tendency
- Bridge between human and divine

Systemic role:
- Dynamic force in spiritual development
- Connector between levels of reality
- Transformative agent
- Integration mechanism

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Aspiration toward ideals
- Transformative love
- Deep yearning for meaning
- Experience of inspiration
- Attraction to excellence/beauty

Contemporary parallels:
- Peak experiences
- Creative inspiration
- Transformative passion
- Self-transcendence
- Evolutionary drive

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The transformative power of spiritual aspiration that elevates human consciousness through profound attraction to truth, beauty, and goodness. It represents the innate human capacity for self-transcendence through love, operating as both motivating force and transformative agent in human development.

[Essential Nature]
This quality manifests as an intense inner attraction toward what is experienced as higher, truer, or more beautiful in life. It begins as ordinary human love and aspiration but progressively refines itself, becoming an increasingly pure desire for truth and meaning. Unlike ordinary desire which seeks to possess its object, this quality transforms the aspirant through attraction to what transcends them.

Operating simultaneously as motivation and method, it draws consciousness upward while simultaneously refining the capacity for deeper appreciation and understanding. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle of elevation and transformation.

[Manifestations]
- Deep attraction to truth, beauty, and excellence
- Progressive refinement of aspirations and desires
- Spontaneous orientation toward higher meaning
- Increasing capacity for subtle appreciation
- Experience of inspiring elevation
- Transformation through what one loves
- Integration of feeling and understanding

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through progressive refinement of attraction and aspiration. Beginning with ordinary experiences of inspiration and love, it gradually shifts focus from particular objects to universal qualities, transforming both the nature of desire and the consciousness experiencing it. The process involves simultaneous intensification and purification, where stronger attraction paradoxically leads to greater freedom.

In practical terms, it manifests as deepening appreciation for excellence in all forms, growing attraction to truth and wisdom, and increasing capacity for inspiration and elevation. This creates tangible changes in values, priorities, and behavior, naturally orienting life toward what has genuine depth and meaning. The quality becomes both guide and transformer, leading through attraction rather than effort.

This universalized description aims to:
- Preserve the transformative and elevating nature of the original concept
- Connect it to universal human experiences of inspiration and aspiration
- Maintain the sophisticated understanding of how it operates
- Make it practically recognizable and applicable
- Retain the depth while removing culture-specific elements

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: Uses universal human experiences of inspiration/aspiration
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding of transformation through attraction
3. Practical applicability: Links to observable experiences and manifestations
4. Individual-universal connection: Shows progression from personal to universal
5. Developmental clarity: Describes clear process of refinement and elevation
6. Observable manifestations: Lists concrete expressions and effects

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
