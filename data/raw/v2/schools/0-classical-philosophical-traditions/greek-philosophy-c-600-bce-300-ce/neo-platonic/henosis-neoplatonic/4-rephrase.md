Let me analyze and transform Henōsis following the structured approach.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Ultimate unification of consciousness with fundamental reality
Key functions: Transcendence, integration, dissolution of subject-object duality
Systemic role: Ultimate goal/culmination of spiritual development
Developmental aspects: Progressive stages of unity consciousness

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Peak experiences of unity
- Dissolution of ego boundaries
- Deep states of absorption
- Transcendent awareness
- Ultimate meaning encounters

Cross-contextual parallels:
- Mystical union (various traditions)
- Pure consciousness experiences
- Flow states
- Deep contemplative absorption
- Transcendent awareness states

Now proceeding to formal composition:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The complete integration of consciousness with fundamental reality, where all separation between knower and known dissolves into perfect unity. This represents the ultimate potential of human awareness where individual consciousness transcends its limitations to realize its essential oneness with the whole of reality.

[Essential Nature]
Henōsis represents the inherent capacity of consciousness to transcend its apparent boundaries and recognize its fundamental unity with reality itself. This quality manifests as progressive stages of integration, from momentary experiences of expanded awareness to stable realization of non-dual consciousness. It operates through the systematic dissolution of the perceived barriers between subject and object, self and other, individual and universal.

Unlike ordinary states of consciousness which maintain a fundamental separation between experiencer and experienced, this quality reveals the underlying unity that precedes all division. It represents both the process of progressive unification and its ultimate fulfillment in complete integration.

[Manifestations]
- Progressive dissolution of subject-object duality in perception
- Expanding circles of identity and belonging
- Decreasing attachment to individual separateness
- Growing recognition of underlying unity in diversity
- Spontaneous experiences of boundary dissolution
- Increasing integration of previously fragmented aspects of experience
- Natural emergence of universal compassion and understanding

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive stages of integration, each dissolving a deeper layer of apparent separation. It begins with temporary experiences of expanded awareness, develops through sustained states of unity consciousness, and culminates in stable realization of fundamental oneness. The process involves both active cultivation through contemplative practices and spontaneous unfolding through direct recognition of reality's unified nature.

In practical expression, this quality manifests as increasing wholeness in perception, action, and understanding. It leads to natural compassion, intuitive wisdom, and spontaneous appropriate action arising from recognition of essential unity. While its ultimate expression transcends ordinary functioning, its development enhances rather than negates effective engagement with relative reality, bringing greater integration and harmony to all aspects of life.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural? Yes - describes universal human potential for transcendent awareness
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language
3. Practical? Yes - includes observable manifestations and developmental aspects
4. Individual-Universal connection? Yes - clearly links personal experience to universal dimension
5. Development clear? Yes - describes progressive stages and process
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - includes verifiable expressions in experience and behavior

This universalized description maintains the profound depth of the Neo-Platonic concept while making it accessible and relevant to contemporary understanding and practice. It preserves the sophisticated philosophical framework while expressing it in experiential terms that can be meaningful across cultural contexts.
