Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Integrative wisdom represents the fusion of deep understanding with direct insight, where knowledge becomes living experience and theoretical understanding transforms into practical wisdom. It manifests as the capacity to perceive, understand, and respond to life's complexities with clarity, depth, and transformative power.

[Essential Nature]
Integrative wisdom emerges when knowledge matures beyond mere accumulation of information into a living, dynamic capacity for understanding. It represents the marriage of detailed comprehension with intuitive grasp of wholeness, combining analytical precision with synthetic vision. This quality transcends the usual separation between knower and known, creating a unified field of understanding that simultaneously encompasses both universal principles and particular situations.

[Manifestations]
- Ability to perceive complex situations with immediate clarity
- Natural integration of theoretical understanding with practical application
- Capacity to recognize underlying patterns and principles
- Effortless translation of wisdom into appropriate action
- Ability to adapt universal principles to specific contexts
- Natural teaching ability that awakens understanding in others
- Balanced judgment that considers multiple perspectives simultaneously

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive integration of experience, reflection, and understanding. It begins with the accumulation of knowledge and experience but transforms through deep reflection and practical application into a unified capacity for understanding. This development involves both analytical refinement and synthetic integration, culminating in a direct, intuitive grasp of reality.

In practical terms, integrative wisdom manifests as the ability to navigate complex situations with clarity and effectiveness. It enables one to see both the forest and the trees simultaneously, to recognize patterns across different domains, and to respond to situations with actions that address both immediate needs and longer-term implications. This wisdom naturally expresses itself through teaching, guidance, and the ability to illuminate understanding in others.

This universalization maintains the essential depth of the Neo-Platonic sophia while making it accessible and relevant to contemporary experience. It preserves the transformative and integrative aspects while expressing them in phenomenological rather than metaphysical terms. The description emphasizes observable manifestations and practical development while retaining the profound nature of the original concept.

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Uses universal human experiences of understanding and insight
2. Depth preservation: Maintains transformative and integrative aspects
3. Practical applicability: Clear connection to real-world situations
4. Individual-universal connection: Links personal development to universal understanding
5. Developmental clarity: Describes progressive integration and transformation
6. Observable manifestations: Focuses on verifiable expressions and capabilities
