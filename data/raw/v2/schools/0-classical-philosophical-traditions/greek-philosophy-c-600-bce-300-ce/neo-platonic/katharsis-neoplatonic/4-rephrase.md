Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
- Core principle: Transformative purification/refinement
- Key functions: Clarification, separation, elevation, refinement
- Systemic role: Foundational process enabling higher development
- Developmental: Progressive refinement across multiple dimensions

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
- Universal experiences: Self-reflection, inner clearing, transformation
- Parallel concepts: Refinement, clarification, inner cleansing
- Contemporary relevance: Mental clarity, emotional processing, personal growth
- Timeless patterns: Progressive refinement, separation of essential/non-essential

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for inner refinement through which mental, emotional, and behavioral patterns are progressively clarified and transformed. It represents the natural human ability to separate essential from non-essential elements of experience, leading to increased clarity, authenticity, and depth of understanding.

[Essential Nature]
Katharsis operates as a fundamental process of human development through which consciousness becomes increasingly refined and clear. It works through a combination of letting go of what obscures or interferes with clear perception and actively cultivating greater precision and depth of awareness. This quality enables transformation through the systematic identification and release of limiting patterns, while simultaneously developing finer discrimination and deeper understanding.

The process is both passive (allowing natural clearing to occur) and active (intentional cultivation of clarity), operating across intellectual, emotional, and behavioral dimensions. It manifests as a progressive journey from confused to clear, complex to simple, and superficial to profound.

[Manifestations]
- Increasing clarity of perception and understanding
- Natural dropping away of unnecessary mental and emotional complications
- Growing ability to distinguish essential from non-essential
- Development of finer discrimination and subtler awareness
- Progressive simplification of response patterns
- Enhanced capacity for direct, unmediated experience
- Movement from scattered to focused attention and energy

[Functional Description]
This quality functions through a natural human capacity for self-reflection and refinement, operating whenever attention turns inward with sufficient stability and duration. It begins with recognition of what clouds or complicates experience, proceeds through willing release of these elements, and culminates in direct, clear apprehension. The process repeats at progressively subtler levels, each stage building upon previous clarifications while revealing new areas for refinement.

In practical terms, it manifests as moments of sudden clarity, gradual refinement of understanding, natural simplification of responses, and increasing authenticity of expression. It supports development across all areas of life by removing obstacles to clear perception and action, while simultaneously developing finer discrimination and more precise understanding. Regular engagement with this process leads to natural simplification and increasing depth in one's approach to life.

This universalization maintains the sophisticated transformative aspects of the Neo-Platonic concept while making it accessible through common human experience. It preserves the systematic nature of katharsis while expressing it in phenomenological rather than theoretical terms.

Verification responses:
1. Yes - describes universal human capacity for refinement
2. Yes - maintains sophisticated transformative aspects
3. Yes - describes observable process with clear applications
4. Yes - links individual clarity to universal understanding
5. Yes - shows progressive nature of development
6. Yes - manifestations are experientially verifiable

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
