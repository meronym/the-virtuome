Let me follow the systematic process for Autarkeia:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Self-contained wholeness and inner sufficiency
Key functions:
- Independence from external conditions
- Internal resource management
- Emotional self-regulation
- Need satisfaction discrimination
- Autonomous functioning capacity

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Need for personal agency
- Desire for freedom from external control
- Search for internal stability
- Development of self-reliance
- Experience of inner resourcefulness

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary pattern: Development from external dependence to internal sufficiency
Key relationships: Links individual capacity with universal principles
Developmental trajectory: Progressive strengthening of inner resources

Here's the universalized description following the requested format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain internal stability and meet core needs through self-contained resources, enabling genuine independence from external conditions while preserving harmonious engagement with life. This quality manifests as a dynamic balance between self-reliance and interconnectedness, grounded in deep understanding of authentic needs.

[Essential Nature]
Inner self-sufficiency represents the human capacity to develop and maintain stable internal resources that enable autonomous functioning. It emerges from the recognition that genuine well-being stems from internal qualities rather than external circumstances, combined with the active development of inner capacities that support independent functioning.

This quality operates at the intersection of self-knowledge, emotional regulation, and resource management, creating a sustainable foundation for authentic living. It differs from isolation or detachment, instead fostering healthy engagement from a position of internal strength and clarity.

[Manifestations]
- Maintaining emotional equilibrium regardless of external circumstances
- Differentiating between authentic needs and conditioned wants
- Accessing internal resources to meet psychological and emotional needs
- Operating from internal reference points while remaining relationally engaged
- Demonstrating resilience through self-contained coping mechanisms
- Expressing authentic choices independent of social pressure
- Sustaining well-being through internal rather than external means

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive recognition and cultivation of internal resources, combined with practical experience in maintaining stability amid changing conditions. It operates through three primary mechanisms: discrimination between authentic and inauthentic needs, development of internal satisfaction pathways, and cultivation of sustainable self-regulation capacities. The process involves both letting go of unnecessary external dependencies and strengthening internal resources.

In practical application, this quality enables individuals to maintain consistent functioning regardless of circumstances, while fostering genuine rather than compulsive engagement with the world. It supports authentic decision-making, emotional resilience, and sustainable well-being through reduced dependency on external conditions. This creates a foundation for both personal freedom and meaningful contribution to collective life.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the core Stoic insight about inner independence
2. Translates philosophical concepts into experiential language
3. Maintains sophistication while increasing accessibility
4. Links individual development to universal human capacity
5. Provides clear markers for practical development
6. Balances individual sufficiency with healthy interconnection

Would you like me to:
1. Further elaborate any aspect?
2. Provide specific development practices?
3. Explore contemporary applications?
4. Analyze relationship patterns with other qualities?
