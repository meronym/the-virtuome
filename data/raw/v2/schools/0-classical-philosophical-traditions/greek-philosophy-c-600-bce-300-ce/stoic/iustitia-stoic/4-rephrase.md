Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS (Iustitia):
Core principle: Right relationship/alignment between parts of a whole
Key functions: 
- Maintains social harmony
- Ensures proper distribution
- Upholds reciprocal duties
- Recognizes inherent dignity
- Balances competing interests

Universal experiences:
- Sense of fairness
- Recognition of dignity
- Need for harmony
- Balance in relationships
- Reciprocal obligations

Here's my attempt at the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize and maintain right relationship between parts within any whole system - whether interpersonal, social, or cosmic. It manifests as an innate sense of appropriate balance, fair exchange, and mutual recognition that enables harmonious cooperation while preserving individual dignity.

[Essential Nature]
This quality emerges from our deep recognition of interconnection and interdependence, combined with our innate sense of balance and proportion. It operates through our capacity to perceive both distinctness and unity - seeing separate elements while understanding their place within larger wholes. This creates a natural tendency toward arrangements that honor both individual dignity and collective harmony.

At its core, it represents the principle of right relationship made conscious and active in human awareness and behavior. It moves beyond mere rules or agreements to express a fundamental truth about how parts relate within wholes while maintaining their proper integrity and function.

[Manifestations]
• Recognition and respect for the inherent dignity and sovereignty of each entity
• Natural sense of appropriate boundaries, limits, and balanced exchange
• Capacity to perceive and maintain right relationship between parts
• Ability to balance competing interests while preserving essential integrity
• Active maintenance of conditions that enable mutual flourishing
• Recognition and fulfillment of reciprocal obligations and duties
• Restoration of harmony when balances are disrupted

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a refined perception that recognizes both separation and unity, individual and collective, rights and duties. It manifests first as an intuitive sense of "rightness" in arrangements and relationships, then develops into conscious understanding of principles that create and maintain harmony. This understanding enables both spontaneous recognition of imbalance and skilled action to restore proper relationship.

In practice, it expresses as the capacity to create and maintain conditions where all parts of a system can fulfill their nature while contributing to the whole. This includes establishing clear boundaries, ensuring fair exchange, protecting individual dignity, and maintaining balanced reciprocity. It enables both preventive maintenance of harmony and restorative action when balance is disrupted.

This reformulation aims to:
- Extract the universal principle from its cultural context
- Ground it in common human experience
- Maintain sophistication while increasing accessibility
- Preserve practical applicability
- Connect individual to collective aspects
- Highlight developmental dimensions

The description emphasizes:
- Phenomenological rather than theoretical language
- Observable manifestations
- Practical functionality
- Universal relevance
- Natural development
- Systemic perspective

Would you like me to:
1. Further refine any particular aspect?
2. Elaborate on specific elements?
3. Add more practical examples?
4. Strengthen particular criteria?
