Let me follow the process systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Recognition and expression of shared human dignity/potential
Key functions:
- Recognition of universal human worth
- Active benevolence towards others
- Bridge-building between differences
- Elevation of human potential
- Practical expression of human unity

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Recognition of shared humanity in others
- Impulse to help/connect
- Transcendence of tribal boundaries
- Experience of human commonality
- Sense of human potential

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary Elements:
- Recognition capacity
- Active benevolence
- Universal perspective
- Practical expression

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, honor, and actively express the fundamental dignity and potential inherent in all human beings, manifesting as practical benevolence, authentic connection, and contribution to human flourishing across all perceived boundaries of difference.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the developed ability to perceive and relate to the essential human element present in all people, transcending surface differences to recognize our shared nature, potential, and fundamental dignity. It combines deep recognition with practical action, moving beyond abstract awareness into genuine care and concrete support for human flourishing.

This recognition naturally expresses itself through active benevolence, arising not from mere duty or ideology but from direct perception of our shared human essence. It manifests as both an internal orientation and an external practice, creating bridges of understanding and cooperation across apparent divisions while nurturing the development of human potential.

[Manifestations]
Recognition Aspects:
- Spontaneous recognition of human dignity in others
- Natural sense of kinship across differences
- Intuitive understanding of human experiences
- Direct perception of human potential

Behavioral Expressions:
- Practical acts of support and kindness
- Creation of inclusive environments
- Active bridge-building across divisions
- Contribution to others' development

Developmental Markers:
- From theoretical to felt understanding
- From group-limited to universal application
- From abstract to practical expression
- From occasional to consistent manifestation

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive expansion of our circle of recognition and care, supported by direct experiences of human commonality and the cultivation of practical wisdom in expressing care effectively. It begins with moments of genuine human connection, deepens through understanding of shared human experiences, and matures into stable recognition combined with skilled action.

In practice, it functions as both a lens of perception and a guide for action, informing how we see others and shaping how we interact with them. It enables us to maintain connection across differences, respond skillfully to human needs, and contribute to the development of human potential in practical ways. This quality becomes particularly vital in situations of conflict, difference, or human need, where it enables maintenance of human connection and constructive engagement.

This universalized description aims to:
1. Capture the essence of Stoic humanitas while making it accessible
2. Connect philosophical insight with practical expression
3. Maintain sophistication while using experiential language
4. Preserve depth while ensuring cross-cultural relevance
5. Provide clear developmental and practical guidance

Would you like me to:
1. Further refine any particular aspect?
2. Expand on the developmental trajectory?
3. Add more practical applications?
4. Strengthen the connection to contemporary contexts?
