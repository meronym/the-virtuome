Let me follow the preparation steps first:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Systematic self-directed development through deliberate challenge
Key functions: 
- Capacity building
- Habit formation
- Character strengthening
- Voluntary difficulty seeking
- Intentional discomfort
Systemic role: Foundational practice enabling other virtues
Developmental aspects: Progressive increase in capacity through structured challenge

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Physical training/exercise
- Overcoming obstacles
- Building resilience
- Personal growth through challenge
Contemporary relevance:
- Athletic training
- Personal development
- Resilience building
- Habit formation
- Stress inoculation

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The deliberate practice of facing chosen challenges and discomfort to develop inner strength and capability. It represents the systematic cultivation of resilience and character through progressive self-directed training, combining physical endurance with mental discipline to expand personal capacity and autonomy.

[Essential Nature]
At its core, this quality embodies the principle that human growth requires intentional engagement with difficulty. It operates through the deliberate selection and systematic confrontation of challenges that push beyond current comfort zones. Unlike random hardship, it involves conscious choice and strategic progression, transforming voluntary discomfort into increased capability.

This quality bridges the gap between potential and actualization through structured practice, recognizing that sustainable personal development requires both systematic approach and direct experience. It combines the wisdom of strategic progression with the transformative power of lived challenge.

[Manifestations]
Physical Domain:
- Voluntary exposure to physical challenges (cold, hunger, fatigue)
- Progressive physical training beyond comfort zones
- Simplified living conditions by choice
- Endurance of natural elements

Mental Domain:
- Deliberate practice of difficult mental tasks
- Voluntary social discomfort for growth
- Systematic study and contemplation
- Meditation and concentration exercises

Behavioral Domain:
- Conscious habit formation and breaking
- Regular practice of self-discipline
- Intentional lifestyle simplification
- Strategic comfort zone expansion

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a feedback loop of challenge, adaptation, and integration. By deliberately engaging with carefully chosen difficulties, it triggers adaptive responses that build capacity. The key mechanism involves the conscious selection of progressive challenges that are neither too easy (preventing growth) nor too overwhelming (causing breakdown), maintaining this optimal zone of development through systematic adjustment.

In practical application, it manifests as a steady commitment to growth-oriented discomfort in daily life. This might involve physical training, simplified living, social challenges, or mental exercises. The practitioner consciously structures their environment and activities to maintain consistent exposure to development-promoting challenges, while monitoring and adjusting the intensity to ensure sustainable progress. The result is increased resilience, capability, and independence across multiple domains of life.

This universalized description:
1. Maintains the core meaning of askesis
2. Makes it accessible to modern understanding
3. Preserves practical applicability
4. Connects individual practice to universal principles
5. Shows clear developmental progression
6. Provides observable manifestations
7. Emphasizes systematic nature while being culturally neutral
8. Retains philosophical sophistication while using accessible language

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
