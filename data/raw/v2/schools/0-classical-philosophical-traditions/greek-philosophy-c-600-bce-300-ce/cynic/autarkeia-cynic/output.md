[Core Definition]
The capacity to meet one's essential needs through internal resources rather than external dependencies, manifesting as progressive independence from material, social, and psychological reliance on factors outside oneself. This quality enables genuine freedom through the cultivation of inner sufficiency.

[Essential Nature]
Self-sufficiency operates as a fundamental human capacity that develops through conscious practice and understanding. It begins with recognizing unnecessary dependencies and progressively building internal resources to meet one's own needs. Unlike mere independence, it represents a positive state of inner completeness rather than just absence of dependence.

This quality exists on a spectrum, from basic material self-reliance to profound psychological self-containment. It serves as both a practical skill and a state of being, enabling other positive qualities through the stable foundation it provides. The development of self-sufficiency creates an expanding sphere of personal freedom and capability.

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a dual process of reducing unnecessary dependencies while building internal capabilities. It begins with identifying areas of excessive reliance on external factors, followed by systematic development of alternative internal resources. The process requires both practical skill-building and psychological development, each reinforcing the other. As internal resources grow, the sphere of personal freedom expands naturally.

In practice, this manifests as a progressive journey from basic self-reliance to profound inner freedom. Early stages focus on practical independence in daily life, while advanced development leads to psychological and spiritual self-containment. This creates a stable foundation for authentic living and enables genuine contribution to others from a place of inner abundance rather than need. The quality becomes self-reinforcing as each step of development enables further growth.
