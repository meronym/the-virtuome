Let me follow the analytical process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF VIRTUS:
Core principle: Excellence-in-action manifesting as integrated moral-practical capability
Key functions: 
- Character development
- Ethical action capacity
- Leadership embodiment
- Social contribution
- Personal development driver

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Developing capability through challenge
- Growing into responsibility
- Actualizing potential
- Contributing meaningfully
- Leading by example

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Primary Patterns:
- Progressive development through action
- Integration of capability with character
- Expression through service/contribution
- Self-transcending orientation

Now, the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The innate human capacity for excellence-in-action, manifesting as the progressive integration of capability, character, and contribution. It represents the active force through which individual potential develops into practical wisdom and meaningful impact, driven by an orientation toward the greater good.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the dynamic intersection of being and doing, where inner development meets outer expression through meaningful action. It manifests as a self-reinforcing cycle where challenging action develops capability, capability enables greater contribution, and contribution shapes character. Unlike static virtues, it is inherently developmental and expressional - not merely what one has become but the active force of becoming.

At its core, it embodies the human capacity to grow through purposeful engagement, transforming potential into practical wisdom through the integration of experience, reflection, and service. This integration produces not just skill or character alone, but a unified excellence that naturally expresses itself through meaningful contribution.

[Manifestations]

Development Pattern:
- Initial phase: Accepting challenges beyond current capability
- Growth phase: Integrating lessons from sustained effort
- Mastery phase: Natural expression of developed excellence
- Leadership phase: Enabling excellence in others

Observable Expressions:
- Taking on meaningful challenges with full engagement
- Maintaining effectiveness under pressure or adversity
- Making decisions that balance capability with responsibility
- Contributing beyond personal interest or requirement
- Demonstrating practical wisdom in complex situations
- Leading through example and earned authority
- Consistently developing self while serving others

[Functional Description]

This quality operates through a dynamic interaction between challenge, capability, and character. When faced with meaningful challenges, it drives engagement rather than avoidance, seeking growth through direct experience. Each challenge becomes an opportunity for development, with success building capability and failure providing essential lessons. This creates an upward spiral where increased capability enables taking on greater challenges, which in turn develops deeper wisdom.

In practical expression, it manifests as a natural authority that comes from demonstrated excellence rather than position or power. Those embodying this quality tend to take on increasing responsibility not from ambition but from recognized capability and willing service. Their leadership emerges organically from the combination of demonstrated capability, ethical character, and genuine contribution to collective good. This creates a model that inspires similar development in others, propagating excellence through example rather than instruction.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the core Roman understanding of active excellence
2. Maintains the integration of capability and character
3. Keeps the developmental/progressive nature
4. Retains the connection to practical wisdom
5. Maintains the service/contribution aspect
6. Translates the concept into observable phenomena
7. Makes it accessible across cultural contexts
8. Retains philosophical sophistication
9. Provides clear developmental pathway
10. Links individual development to collective benefit

The description passes the verification questions by:
- Using universal human experiences as reference points
- Maintaining the depth of the original concept
- Providing clear practical applications
- Connecting individual development to universal patterns
- Outlining clear developmental progression
- Focusing on observable manifestations
