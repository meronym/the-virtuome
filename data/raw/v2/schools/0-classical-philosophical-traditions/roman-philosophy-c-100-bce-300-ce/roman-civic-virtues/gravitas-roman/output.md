[Core Definition]
The quality of earned authority expressed through composed presence and measured action, reflecting deep integration of experience, responsibility, and wisdom. It manifests as natural weight of character that commands respect and attention while creating stability in social systems through consistent, considered conduct.

[Essential Nature]
Gravitas emerges from the mature integration of experience, responsibility, and self-awareness, expressing itself as a natural authority that doesn't demand attention but naturally draws it. It represents the embodied wisdom of one who has internalized the weight of consequence and responsibility, developing a presence that naturally stabilizes and orders their environment.

This quality balances internal strength with external restraint, combining deep capability with measured expression. It manifests as a form of social gravity - a stabilizing force that anchors collective dynamics through consistent, considered conduct and reliable judgment.

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through the integration of internal development and external expression. As one accumulates experience and responsibility, developing deeper understanding of consequences and interconnections, this naturally transforms their presence and conduct. The weight of understanding translates into measured action, while accumulated wisdom manifests as natural authority.

In practice, this quality creates stability and order through consistent, considered conduct rather than forced control. It enables leadership through natural authority rather than imposed power, drawing others to align with its stabilizing influence. This quality serves as a social anchor, providing reference points for appropriate conduct and decision-making while naturally moderating group dynamics through its steady presence.
