HISTORICAL CONTEXT\n- Neo-Stoicism emerged during a period of intense religious conflict and political instability\n- It needed to address both personal conduct and public service\n- It aimed to bridge classical wisdom with Christian faith\n\n2. CORE INNOVATIONS\n- Synthesis of private moral philosophy with public action\n- Integration of contemplative wisdom with practical governance\n- Balance between religious faith and rational philosophy\n\n3.

Must represent both personal and public dimensions\n2. Should reflect the Christian-Stoic synthesis\n3. Must include both contemplative and active elements\n4. Should capture both theoretical wisdom and practical application\n5. Must address both individual character and social responsibility\n\nBased on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of the most representative virtues:\n\n1. CONSTANTIA (Steadfastness)\n- The cornerstone virtue of Neo-Stoicism\n- Represents stability of mind and character\n- Bridges personal resilience and public service\n\n2.

MODERATIO (Moderation)\n- Balances different demands and extremes\n- Applies to both personal conduct and public policy\n- Essential for practical wisdom\n\n6. SAPIENTIA ACTIVA (Active Wisdom)\n- Combines contemplative knowledge with practical action\n- Represents the educational ideal\n- Guides both personal development and public service\n\n7. DECORUM CIVILE (Civil Propriety)\n- Combines personal dignity with social grace\n- Represents cultural refinement and public behavior\n- Essential for social harmony\n\n8.
