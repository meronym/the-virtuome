Let me follow the process step by step:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Strategic wisdom in collective decision-making and governance
Key functions: 
- Discernment of optimal courses of action
- Integration of ethical and practical considerations
- Navigation of complex social dynamics
- Long-term strategic thinking
Systemic role: Bridge between theoretical understanding and practical governance

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Group decision-making
- Leadership responsibility
- Balancing competing interests
- Strategic planning
- Ethical decision-making under constraints

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary elements:
- Practical wisdom in collective contexts
- Strategic foresight
- Ethical judgment
- Situational adaptability

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to navigate complex collective decisions by integrating deep understanding with practical effectiveness, balancing multiple interests and considerations while maintaining ethical integrity and long-term perspective. This quality enables wisdom-guided action in contexts of shared responsibility and collective impact.

[Essential Nature]
Strategic wisdom represents the mature development of judgment in collective contexts, where theoretical understanding meets practical necessity. It manifests as the ability to grasp complex situations holistically, discerning optimal courses of action that serve both immediate needs and longer-term good. This quality integrates multiple forms of intelligence: analytical comprehension of systems, emotional understanding of human dynamics, ethical discernment of right action, and practical awareness of implementation challenges.

At its core, it embodies the bridge between understanding and action, between individual insight and collective benefit, between immediate necessity and future consequence. It operates through continuous refinement of judgment through experience, reflection, and adaptation.

[Manifestations]
- Clear discernment in complex situations requiring balance of multiple legitimate interests
- Effective navigation of competing priorities while maintaining ethical integrity
- Strategic foresight that anticipates consequences and plans accordingly
- Practical wisdom in implementation, adapting principles to circumstances
- Integration of analytical understanding with experiential knowledge
- Development of sustainable solutions that serve collective wellbeing
- Capacity to build consensus and facilitate collective action

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive integration of theoretical understanding with practical experience, continuously refined through reflection on outcomes and adaptation to new challenges. It operates through a dynamic process of situation assessment, principle identification, possibility exploration, and judgment application. The development path involves expanding perspective from immediate to long-term, from simple to complex, and from individual to collective considerations.

In practice, it manifests as the ability to guide collective decision-making and action in ways that serve both immediate needs and longer-term development. It enables leaders and participants in collective enterprises to navigate complex challenges while maintaining both effectiveness and ethical integrity. This quality proves essential in any context requiring coordination of multiple actors toward shared objectives while accounting for diverse interests and perspectives.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the sophisticated understanding of judgment in collective contexts
2. Makes the concept accessible without reference to specific political systems
3. Maintains practical applicability across different organizational contexts
4. Links individual development to collective benefit
5. Provides clear markers for development and manifestation
6. Offers concrete ways to recognize and cultivate the quality

The description emphasizes phenomenological experience over theoretical framework while maintaining the depth and sophistication of the original Neo-Stoic concept. It translates political specificity into broader principles of collective action and decision-making, making it relevant across cultural contexts while preserving the essential wisdom about leadership and governance.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect or adjust the focus in any way?
