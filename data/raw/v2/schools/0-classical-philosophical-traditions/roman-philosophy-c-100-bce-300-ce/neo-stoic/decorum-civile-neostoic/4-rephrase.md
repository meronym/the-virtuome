Let me follow the process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Harmonious social conduct aligned with deeper principles
Functions: Social cohesion, cultural refinement, public dignity
Systemic role: Bridges personal virtue and social harmony
Developmental aspects: Progressive refinement of social awareness and conduct

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Navigation of social spaces
- Cultural participation
- Public self-presentation
- Community integration

Contemporary parallels:
- Professional ethics
- Social intelligence
- Cultural competence
- Public leadership

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary Elements:
- Social awareness and responsiveness
- Cultural fluency
- Dignified conduct
- Community contribution

Secondary Elements:
- Social anxiety/awkwardness (obstacle)
- Educational/cultural exposure (condition)
- Emotional intelligence (related quality)
- Social leadership (application)

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to move through social spaces with awareness, grace, and positive impact, manifesting inner development through outer conduct that elevates both individual and collective dignity while fostering harmonious community participation.

[Essential Nature]
Social grace emerges from the integration of deep self-awareness with genuine concern for collective harmony. It represents the embodied wisdom of understanding how personal conduct affects social fabric, combining careful attention to context with authentic expression of character. This quality manifests as a natural elegance in navigating social complexity, neither artificial nor forced, but flowing from developed social consciousness and genuine respect for human dignity.

[Manifestations]
- Situational awareness that allows appropriate modulation of behavior across contexts
- Natural elegance in social interactions that puts others at ease
- Capacity to maintain personal authenticity while honoring social frameworks
- Ability to elevate social discourse and interaction through presence
- Pattern of conduct that encourages others' best expression
- Cultural fluency that bridges different social contexts
- Leadership presence that naturally draws forth collective dignity

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of social awareness combined with deepening self-knowledge. It begins with conscious attention to social impact and evolves into intuitive understanding of how to contribute to collective harmony. The development process involves both internal cultivation of awareness and external practice in varied social contexts, gradually integrating into natural, unforced expression.

Its practical expression manifests as a form of social leadership that naturally elevates the quality of collective interaction. Rather than mere politeness or etiquette, it represents the embodied wisdom of how to foster genuine human connection while maintaining appropriate boundaries and respecting social structures. This creates spaces where both individual authenticity and collective harmony can flourish.

This universalization maintains the sophistication of the Neo-Stoic concept while making it accessible across cultural contexts. It preserves the deep connection between individual development and social impact while expressing it in phenomenological rather than theoretical terms.

The description emphasizes observable manifestations and practical development while retaining the philosophical depth of the original concept. It connects individual experience to universal human patterns of social interaction and community building.

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural meaning ✓ (focuses on universal social dynamics)
2. Preserves depth ✓ (maintains connection between inner development and outer expression)
3. Practical applicability ✓ (clear manifestations and development path)
4. Individual-universal connection ✓ (links personal conduct to collective harmony)
5. Development clarity ✓ (progressive refinement path described)
6. Observable manifestations ✓ (concrete behavioral indicators provided)
