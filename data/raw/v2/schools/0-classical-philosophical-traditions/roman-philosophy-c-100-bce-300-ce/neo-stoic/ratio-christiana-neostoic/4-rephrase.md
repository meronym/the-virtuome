Let me break this down systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Integration of rational discernment with transcendent wisdom
Key functions:
- Harmonizing different modes of understanding
- Bridging analytical and contemplative knowledge
- Guiding ethical decision-making
- Integrating theoretical and practical wisdom

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Reconciling different ways of knowing
- Integrating head and heart wisdom
- Balancing analysis with intuition
- Seeking deeper meaning in rational understanding

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary: Integrative wisdom that combines analytical clarity with deeper understanding
Secondary: Development of mature judgment that transcends false dichotomies

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to integrate analytical understanding with deeper wisdom, combining clear discernment with profound insight. This quality enables one to approach truth through multiple complementary pathways while maintaining both intellectual rigor and openness to transcendent understanding.

[Essential Nature]
Integrative wisdom represents the mature development of human consciousness where different modes of understanding are harmoniously unified rather than conflicting. It manifests as the ability to engage both critical thinking and deeper intuitive knowledge, without sacrificing either clarity or depth. This quality enables one to navigate complex situations with both careful analysis and holistic understanding, recognizing that truth often requires multiple complementary approaches to be fully grasped.

[Manifestations]
- Balanced judgment that considers both logical analysis and deeper principles
- Ability to bridge apparent contradictions through higher-order understanding
- Integration of theoretical knowledge with experiential wisdom
- Recognition of multiple valid pathways to understanding
- Practical wisdom that combines careful analysis with profound insight
- Capacity to communicate complex truths in accessible ways
- Development of mature discernment that transcends false dichotomies

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive integration of different modes of knowing, starting with the recognition that truth can be approached through multiple complementary pathways. It involves cultivating both analytical precision and deeper insight, eventually leading to a unified understanding that transcends but includes both. The process requires ongoing practice in holding multiple perspectives while maintaining clear discernment.

In practical application, this integrated wisdom enables more effective decision-making by drawing on both careful analysis and deeper understanding. It allows one to navigate complex situations with greater clarity and depth, while maintaining the ability to communicate insights effectively to others. This quality is particularly valuable in leadership, education, and any context requiring both clear thinking and profound understanding.

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural validity: ✓ (focuses on universal human capacities)
2. Depth preservation: ✓ (maintains sophisticated understanding while broadening context)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear practical manifestations and applications)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (links personal development to universal principles)
5. Developmental clarity: ✓ (describes progressive integration and maturation)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (concrete expressions identified)

The description maintains the sophisticated integration at the heart of Ratio Christiana while making it accessible beyond its original Christian-Stoic context. It preserves the core insight about integrating different modes of understanding while expressing it in universal terms applicable across cultural and philosophical frameworks.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
