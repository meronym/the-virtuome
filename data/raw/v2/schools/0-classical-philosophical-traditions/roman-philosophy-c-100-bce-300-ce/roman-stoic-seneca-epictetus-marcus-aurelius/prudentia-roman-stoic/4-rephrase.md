Let me follow this systematic approach for Prudentia.

INITIAL ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Integration of knowledge and action through sound judgment
Key functions: Decision-making, situational assessment, practical reasoning
Systemic role: Guides application of other virtues, bridges theory and practice
Developmental aspects: Builds through experience, reflection, and mentorship

UNIVERSAL ELEMENTS:
- Present in all decision-making processes
- Essential for navigating complexity
- Fundamental to human learning and adaptation
- Critical for leadership and personal development

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to discern appropriate action through the integration of understanding, experience, and awareness. It manifests as sound judgment that considers context, consequences, and deeper principles, enabling effective navigation of life's complexities while maintaining alignment with what is truly important.

[Essential Nature]
Practical wisdom emerges from the dynamic interaction between knowledge and experience, refined through reflection and application. It represents the mind's ability to grasp both universal principles and particular circumstances, bridging the gap between understanding and action. This quality develops through the conscious integration of learning from experience, careful observation of consequences, and deep reflection on patterns and principles.

Unlike purely theoretical knowledge or mere practical skill, it embodies the mature capacity to recognize what truly matters in any situation and to determine appropriate action that serves both immediate needs and longer-term flourishing. It operates at the intersection of insight and implementation, wisdom and practicality.

[Manifestations]
- Clear discernment in complex situations, identifying core issues and appropriate responses
- Balanced consideration of multiple factors, stakeholders, and timeframes
- Effective adaptation of principles to specific contexts while maintaining integrity
- Recognition of optimal timing and approach for actions and interventions
- Integration of past experience with present awareness to guide future action
- Capacity to anticipate consequences and prepare for contingencies
- Development of increasingly refined judgment through reflection on experience

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous cycle of perception, integration, and action. It begins with clear recognition of what is present, drawing on accumulated experience and understanding to identify patterns and principles. This initial assessment is then refined through consideration of unique contextual factors, potential consequences, and deeper implications. The final phase involves determining appropriate action that addresses immediate needs while serving long-term development and universal principles.

In practice, this manifests as the ability to navigate complex situations with clarity and effectiveness. It enables one to make decisions that are both practical and principled, to adapt universal wisdom to particular circumstances, and to learn continuously from experience. This quality develops through conscious attention to outcomes, regular reflection on experience, and the progressive refinement of judgment through application in varied contexts.
