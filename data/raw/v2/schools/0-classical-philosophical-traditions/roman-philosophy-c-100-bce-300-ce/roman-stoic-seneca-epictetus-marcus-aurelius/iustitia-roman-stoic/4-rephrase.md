Let me analyze and transform Iustitia following the outlined process.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Right relationship/proper order between parts within a whole
Key functions: 
- Maintaining harmony in systems
- Allocating resources/responsibilities
- Balancing competing interests
- Upholding natural order
- Protecting individual dignity within collective

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS:
Universal experiences:
- Sense of fairness
- Need for balanced relationships
- Recognition of reciprocity
- Intuition of proper order
- Desire for harmony

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary pattern: Recognition and maintenance of right relationship between parts and whole
Secondary patterns: Balance, reciprocity, harmony, order, fairness

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, establish, and maintain right relationship between parts within a whole, manifesting as the intuitive sense of fairness, the practical wisdom of proper distribution, and the active maintenance of harmony within systems of relationship from personal to universal scales.

[Essential Nature]
Right relationship is a fundamental pattern of reality that humans can perceive, understand, and consciously maintain. It manifests as an intuitive sense of fairness, a rational understanding of proper proportion, and a practical ability to establish and maintain harmony within systems. This capacity operates simultaneously at personal, interpersonal, and universal levels, linking individual conscience with cosmic order.

This quality combines receptive awareness (recognizing what is proper), analytical understanding (discerning right proportion), and active implementation (maintaining harmony). It requires both inner development of perception and judgment, and outer development of action and implementation.

[Manifestations]
- Intuitive recognition of fairness/unfairness in situations
- Capacity to discern proper proportion in distribution
- Ability to balance competing interests and needs
- Skill in maintaining harmony within systems
- Active protection of right relationship at all scales
- Development of increasingly subtle perception of order
- Growth from personal fairness to universal harmony

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of perception, understanding, and implementation. It begins with basic fairness intuition, develops through reason and experience into practical wisdom, and matures into profound understanding of natural order. The development process integrates emotional sensitivity, rational analysis, and practical skill in maintaining harmony.

In practice, this quality enables one to navigate complex systems while maintaining their proper functioning. It manifests as fair dealing in personal relationships, wise management in organizational contexts, and harmonious stewardship in broader systems. The quality brings clarity to difficult decisions, wisdom to resource allocation, and skill in maintaining sustainable order across all scales of relationship.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the core Roman Stoic insights about justice's relationship to natural order
2. Makes the concept accessible through universal human experiences
3. Maintains practical applicability
4. Links personal development to universal principles
5. Provides observable manifestations
6. Offers clear developmental trajectory

The description should be meaningful across cultures while maintaining the philosophical sophistication of the original concept. It connects individual experience to universal principles and provides practical guidance for development and application.

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universalization?
