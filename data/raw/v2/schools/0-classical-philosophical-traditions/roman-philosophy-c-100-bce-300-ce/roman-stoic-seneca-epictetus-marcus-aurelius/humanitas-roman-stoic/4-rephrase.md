Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF HUMANITAS:
Core principle: Refined expression of human potential through cultivation of both intellect and character
Functions: Cultural development, ethical refinement, social connection, universal fellowship
Systemic role: Bridges individual development with social responsibility
Developmental aspects: Progressive refinement through education, cultural engagement, and ethical practice

2. UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Human connection and fellowship
- Cultural and intellectual growth
- Ethical development
- Social responsibility
- Recognition of shared humanity

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary elements:
- Essence: Cultivated expression of human excellence
- Observable: Cultural refinement, ethical behavior, social engagement
- Development: Through education, practice, and social interaction
- Relationships: Individual growth supporting collective advancement

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The cultivated capacity to express the highest potential of human nature through the integration of intellectual development, ethical refinement, and active care for others. It manifests as a dynamic balance of personal excellence and social responsibility, grounded in recognition of universal human dignity.

[Essential Nature]
Human excellence emerges through the conscious development of our inherent capacities for understanding, ethical behavior, and meaningful connection with others. This quality represents the mature expression of human potential, where individual refinement naturally flows into concern for collective wellbeing. It combines deep appreciation for human culture with practical commitment to human flourishing, manifesting as both personal development and social responsibility.

[Manifestations]
Individual Domain:
- Continuous pursuit of knowledge and understanding
- Cultivation of ethical judgment and behavior
- Development of cultural appreciation and refinement
- Integration of learning with practical wisdom

Interpersonal Domain:
- Recognition and respect for human dignity in all
- Active engagement in mentorship and teaching
- Practical support for others' development
- Cultivation of meaningful relationships

Social Domain:
- Contribution to cultural and social advancement
- Engagement in collective problem-solving
- Protection and promotion of human dignity
- Stewardship of human knowledge and achievements

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of natural human capacities. Beginning with basic education and cultural exposure, it deepens through critical reflection, ethical practice, and meaningful engagement with others. The process involves simultaneous development of intellectual understanding, ethical sensitivity, and practical wisdom, each aspect reinforcing and enriching the others.

In practice, it manifests as a natural movement between personal development and social contribution. Those embodying this quality seamlessly combine continued self-refinement with active support for others' growth. Their presence naturally elevates social interactions, creating environments conducive to human flourishing while addressing practical challenges with both wisdom and compassion.

This universalized description:
- Preserves the Roman virtue's sophisticated integration of personal and social development
- Translates cultural refinement into universal human capacities
- Maintains the practical emphasis characteristic of Roman Stoicism
- Links individual excellence with collective responsibility
- Provides observable manifestations across multiple domains
- Offers clear developmental trajectory
- Retains both philosophical depth and practical applicability

The description should be meaningful across cultures while preserving the essential sophistication of the original Roman concept. It connects individual development with universal human potential and provides clear pathways for practical development.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the specified criteria?
