Let me follow the process systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Integration of inner worth with outer conduct
Key functions: 
- Self-respect maintenance
- Social responsibility bearing
- Ethical conduct guidance
- Personal sovereignty establishment
Systemic role: Links personal integrity to social impact

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS:
Universal experiences:
- Recognition of inherent human worth
- Need for self-respect
- Responsibility of representation
- Balance of inner/outer alignment
Contemporary parallels:
- Professional integrity
- Personal boundaries
- Human rights
- Leadership presence

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary: Self-worth actualization through conduct
Secondary: Social impact through personal example

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The conscious embodiment of inherent human worth through aligned thought, conduct, and presence. This quality manifests as the natural integration of self-respect, appropriate action, and social responsibility, expressing inner nobility through outer conduct while maintaining sovereignty of self.

[Essential Nature]
Human dignity operates as both an innate recognition and an active practice - the deep awareness of fundamental worth combined with the responsibility to manifest it. It functions as the bridge between internal state and external expression, creating a natural congruence between being and doing. This quality serves as an internal compass for conduct, relationships, and decisions, maintaining personal sovereignty while acknowledging interconnection.

Unlike superficial status or social position, true dignity emerges from the authentic recognition and expression of human worth, manifesting as a natural authority that requires no external validation yet generates natural respect.

[Manifestations]
- Composed presence that naturally commands respect without demanding it
- Measured speech and action that reflects deep self-awareness
- Maintenance of appropriate boundaries without aggression
- Equal treatment of others regardless of status
- Protection of both personal and others' worth through conduct
- Progressive refinement of conduct to match inner development
- Natural authority emerging from authentic self-expression

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive alignment of inner recognition with outer expression. It begins with the fundamental appreciation of human worth - both personal and universal - and matures through the conscious cultivation of conduct that authentically expresses this worth. The development process involves continuous refinement of awareness, choice, and action, creating increasing congruence between internal state and external manifestation.

In practical application, this quality guides personal conduct, professional interaction, and social engagement. It manifests as natural authority in leadership, appropriate boundaries in relationships, and ethical clarity in decisions. Rather than rigid formality, it expresses as natural grace under pressure, appropriate response to circumstances, and the ability to maintain self-respect while extending respect to others. This quality particularly shines in challenging situations, where it enables maintaining composure without compromising integrity.

This universalization preserves the Roman virtue's essence while making it accessible across cultures and practically applicable in contemporary contexts. It maintains the sophistication of the original philosophical concept while grounding it in universal human experience and observable manifestations.

Does this translation meet the verification criteria? Would you like me to adjust any aspect to better serve the objective?
