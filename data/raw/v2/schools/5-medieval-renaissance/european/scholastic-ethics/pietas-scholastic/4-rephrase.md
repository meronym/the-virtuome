Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Pietas:
Core principle: Sacred regard and proper relationship with sources of life/meaning
Key functions: 
- Orders relationships with divine, family, community
- Integrates duty with reverence
- Structures meaningful connections
- Maintains cultural/spiritual continuity

Relationship patterns:
- Vertical (authority/source)
- Horizontal (community/tradition)
- Internal (personal meaning/identity)
- Temporal (past/present/future)

2. UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Recognition of life's sources
- Sense of sacred obligation
- Generational continuity
- Cultural belonging
- Meaningful participation

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Core function: Integration of reverence and responsibility
Manifestations: Gratitude, care, commitment, participation
Development: From imitation to internalization to integration
Systemic role: Creates stable meaningful relationships

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, honor, and actively maintain life-giving relationships through both reverence and responsibility. It manifests as an integrated attitude of grateful respect and committed care toward the sources of our existence, meaning, and belonging - whether family, tradition, nature, or ultimate reality.

[Essential Nature]
Sacred responsibility represents the human faculty for maintaining meaningful connection with the sources of life and meaning. It integrates emotional reverence with practical commitment, combining deep respect with active care. This quality enables us to recognize what nurtures and sustains us - whether physically, culturally, or spiritually - and to respond appropriately through both attitude and action.

This faculty operates at multiple levels: in personal relationships through gratitude and care, in cultural participation through engaged responsibility, and in spiritual life through reverent attention. It creates coherence between receiving and giving, between past and future, between individual and community.

[Manifestations]
- Grateful recognition of life's sources and supports
- Active care for family, mentors, and nurturing relationships
- Engaged participation in cultural and spiritual traditions
- Responsible stewardship of inherited wisdom and resources
- Commitment to passing on what sustains and enriches life
- Integration of reverence with practical responsibility
- Balance of receptivity and active contribution

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive recognition of our fundamental interdependence and the sacred nature of life-giving relationships. It begins with simple gratitude and imitated respect, matures through personal recognition of value and meaning, and culminates in conscious commitment to maintain and transmit what truly sustains life and meaning. The development involves both deepening awareness and expanding scope of concern.

In practice, it manifests as an integrated way of being that combines inner reverence with outer responsibility. This creates stable, meaningful relationships characterized by both respect and active care. It enables cultural continuity while allowing for growth and adaptation, maintaining connection with sources of meaning while responding to present needs. The quality supports both personal wholeness and social coherence through proper recognition and response to what gives and sustains life.

This universalization maintains the core insights of scholastic pietas while making them accessible across cultural contexts. It preserves the integration of inner disposition with outer action, the connection between reverence and responsibility, and the multi-level operation (personal, cultural, spiritual) that characterized the original virtue.

The description emphasizes observable manifestations and practical development while retaining the depth of the concept. It connects individual experience to universal human patterns of meaning-making and relationship-maintaining.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this universalization?
