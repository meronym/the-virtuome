Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS (Prudentia):
Core principle: Practical wisdom in action/decision-making
Key functions: 
- Discernment of right action
- Integration of principles with circumstances
- Guidance of moral behavior
- Bridge between knowledge and action

Universal experiences:
- Decision-making under complexity
- Balancing competing demands
- Learning from experience
- Practical problem-solving
- Moral navigation

Here's my attempt at the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to discern and implement wise courses of action by integrating understanding, experience, and foresight. It enables effective navigation of complex situations while maintaining alignment with deeper principles and long-term good, manifesting as practical wisdom in daily life and critical moments.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the mature development of human judgment, where intellectual understanding meets practical capability. It operates as an integrative faculty, combining clear perception of current circumstances, understanding of underlying principles, appreciation of potential consequences, and recognition of meaningful patterns derived from experience. Unlike purely theoretical knowledge or mere practical skill, it embodies the wisdom that emerges when deep understanding meets lived experience.

Beyond individual decision-making, it functions as a master capability that guides the development and expression of other human excellences, ensuring their appropriate application in real-world contexts. It transforms abstract understanding into practical wisdom, principles into actions, and knowledge into results.

[Manifestations]
- Clear discernment in complex situations, seeing both immediate factors and broader implications
- Balanced judgment that considers multiple perspectives and timeframes
- Effective action that achieves objectives while maintaining principles
- Pattern recognition that draws meaningfully from past experience
- Adaptive response to novel situations based on understanding of fundamentals
- Integration of theoretical knowledge with practical requirements
- Guidance of others through wisdom rather than mere instruction

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the iterative interaction between understanding and experience, gradually building a sophisticated capacity for judgment. It begins with basic pattern recognition and rule-following, evolves through active learning from experience, and matures into nuanced discernment that can navigate novel situations. The development process requires both theoretical understanding and practical engagement, supported by reflection on experience and openness to learning from outcomes.

In practice, it manifests as the ability to make sound decisions in complex situations, guide others effectively, and maintain long-term alignment with principles while adapting to immediate circumstances. It enables both strategic thinking and tactical effectiveness, operating as a bridge between ideal and real, theory and practice, principle and action. This quality particularly shines in situations requiring balanced judgment, where multiple factors must be weighed and long-term implications considered.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: Yes - focuses on universal human experiences of decision-making and wisdom
2. Depth preservation: Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear connection to real-world situations and decisions
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - links personal development to universal patterns of wisdom
5. Developmental clarity: Yes - shows progression from basic to sophisticated judgment
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - provides concrete, verifiable expressions

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universal reformulation?
