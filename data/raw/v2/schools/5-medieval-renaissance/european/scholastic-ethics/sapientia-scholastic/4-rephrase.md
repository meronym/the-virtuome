Let me follow the process systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Integration of knowledge with wisdom; understanding through highest causes
Functions: Orders knowledge, guides judgment, integrates understanding, directs learning
Systemic role: Crowning intellectual virtue, bridges theoretical and practical
Developmental: Progresses from basic knowledge through understanding to unified wisdom

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Search for deeper meaning
- Integration of learning
- Growth in understanding
- Pattern recognition across domains
- Development of perspective
- Maturing judgment

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary function: Integration and elevation of understanding
Observable manifestations: Judgment quality, teaching ability, perspective depth
Development path: Knowledge → Understanding → Integration → Wisdom
Systemic position: Organizing principle for knowledge and experience

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to perceive and understand the deeper patterns of reality, integrating knowledge, experience, and insight into a coherent whole that reveals meaningful connections and fundamental principles. This quality enables both profound understanding and practical guidance, unifying theoretical comprehension with lived wisdom.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the mind's highest integrative function, through which scattered knowledge becomes coherent understanding and isolated insights merge into unified wisdom. It operates by recognizing fundamental patterns, establishing meaningful connections, and perceiving the deeper significance beneath surface appearances. Unlike mere accumulation of knowledge, it involves a transformative comprehension that changes not only what we know but how we know, enabling us to grasp both universal principles and their particular applications.

[Manifestations]
- Ability to identify core principles across diverse situations
- Capacity to connect theoretical understanding with practical application
- Skill in recognizing meaningful patterns in complexity
- Development of nuanced, context-aware judgment
- Integration of knowledge from multiple domains
- Teaching ability that illuminates fundamental principles
- Balance between intellectual humility and confident understanding

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a progressive refinement of understanding, where initial knowledge deepens into insight and fragmentary comprehension evolves into integrated wisdom. It grows through the continual interplay between learning and experience, theoretical understanding and practical application, requiring both active intellectual engagement and receptive contemplation. Each new level of understanding reorganizes and reintegrates previous knowledge into more comprehensive patterns.

In practice, this quality manifests as the ability to see through surface complexity to underlying principles, to recognize significant patterns across different domains, and to apply deep understanding to practical situations. It enables both enhanced comprehension of reality's fundamental nature and improved practical judgment in navigating life's challenges. This integration of deep understanding with practical wisdom makes it particularly valuable for leadership, teaching, and complex decision-making.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Uses universal human experiences of learning and understanding
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible
3. Practical applicability: Clear connections to real-world application
4. Individual-universal connection: Links personal development to universal understanding
5. Development clarity: Shows progression from knowledge through understanding to wisdom
6. Observable manifestations: Concrete indicators of the quality's presence

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
