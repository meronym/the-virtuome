[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, establish, and maintain right relationships between all elements of a system, ensuring each part receives what it needs and contributes what it should. This quality enables both fair individual interactions and the creation of equitable systems that support human flourishing.

[Essential Nature]
Justice represents the dynamic balance that emerges when relationships are properly ordered according to the true nature and needs of all involved. It operates simultaneously at multiple levels - from simple exchanges between individuals to complex social systems - always seeking to establish and maintain patterns of interaction that honor both the uniqueness of each element and the wellbeing of the whole.

This quality combines precise discernment of what is due with an understanding of broader contexts and consequences, enabling solutions that address immediate needs while building sustainable, life-supporting patterns of relationship.

[Functional Description]
Justice operates through continuous assessment and adjustment of relationships at all levels, from simple exchanges to complex social systems. It begins with recognition of the legitimate needs and claims of all parties, develops through increasingly sophisticated understanding of contexts and consequences, and manifests in actions that create and maintain right relationship. This quality grows through progressive recognition of broader contexts and deeper implications of actions.

In practice, justice expresses itself through fair dealings in daily interactions, creation of equitable systems and processes, and ongoing work to recognize and correct imbalances. It requires both clear perception of immediate situations and understanding of broader patterns, combining immediate fairness with long-term sustainability. The capacity develops through experience with increasingly complex situations, supported by reflection on consequences and cultivation of broader perspective.
