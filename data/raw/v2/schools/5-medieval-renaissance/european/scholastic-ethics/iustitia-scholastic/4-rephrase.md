Let me follow the process systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Right relationship/right ordering
Functions: 
- Balancing competing claims
- Maintaining social harmony
- Distributing resources/opportunities
- Rectifying wrongs
- Establishing fair systems
Systemic role: Foundation of social order, framework for human relationships
Developmental: Progresses from simple fairness to complex systemic understanding

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Need for fairness
- Distribution of limited resources
- Conflict resolution
- Rights and responsibilities
- Social harmony
Contemporary applications:
- Organizational ethics
- Social systems design
- Conflict resolution
- Resource allocation
- Rights frameworks

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary:
- Core: Right ordering of relationships
- Observable: Fair dealings, equitable systems
- Development: Personal fairness â†’ systemic justice
- Relations: Foundation for cooperation/trust

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, establish, and maintain right relationships between all elements of a system, ensuring each part receives what it needs and contributes what it should. This quality enables both fair individual interactions and the creation of equitable systems that support human flourishing.

[Essential Nature]
Justice represents the dynamic balance that emerges when relationships are properly ordered according to the true nature and needs of all involved. It operates simultaneously at multiple levels - from simple exchanges between individuals to complex social systems - always seeking to establish and maintain patterns of interaction that honor both the uniqueness of each element and the wellbeing of the whole.

This quality combines precise discernment of what is due with an understanding of broader contexts and consequences, enabling solutions that address immediate needs while building sustainable, life-supporting patterns of relationship.

[Manifestations]
Personal:
- Recognition of others' rights and legitimate claims
- Willingness to give each their due despite personal cost
- Ability to balance competing valid claims
- Development of increasingly sophisticated understanding of fairness
- Active engagement in creating and maintaining fair systems

Interpersonal:
- Fair and honest dealings in all exchanges
- Recognition and respect for others' rights
- Balanced assessment of conflicts
- Equal consideration of all legitimate interests

Systemic:
- Creation of equitable structures and processes
- Fair distribution of resources and opportunities
- Protection of vulnerable elements within the system
- Maintenance of sustainable balance in complex networks

[Functional Description]
Justice operates through continuous assessment and adjustment of relationships at all levels, from simple exchanges to complex social systems. It begins with recognition of the legitimate needs and claims of all parties, develops through increasingly sophisticated understanding of contexts and consequences, and manifests in actions that create and maintain right relationship. This quality grows through progressive recognition of broader contexts and deeper implications of actions.

In practice, justice expresses itself through fair dealings in daily interactions, creation of equitable systems and processes, and ongoing work to recognize and correct imbalances. It requires both clear perception of immediate situations and understanding of broader patterns, combining immediate fairness with long-term sustainability. The capacity develops through experience with increasingly complex situations, supported by reflection on consequences and cultivation of broader perspective.

This universalized description:
1. Maintains the sophistication of scholastic analysis
2. Translates theoretical concepts into experiential language
3. Preserves both individual and systemic dimensions
4. Emphasizes practical manifestations
5. Includes developmental aspects
6. Links personal practice to universal principles
7. Makes contemporary relevance clear
8. Is accessible across cultural contexts

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this universalization process or the resulting description?
