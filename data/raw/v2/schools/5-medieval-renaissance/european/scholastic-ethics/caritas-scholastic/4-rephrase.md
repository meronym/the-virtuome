Let me follow the analytical process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Caritas:
Core principle: Expansive, transformative love that transcends self-interest
Key functions: 
- Unifies individual with greater good
- Transforms motivation and perception
- Creates sustainable positive action
- Bridges personal and universal
Systemic role: Acts as both foundation and culmination of human development

2. UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Transcendent love experiences
- Moments of profound connection
- Selfless care impulses
- Expansion beyond ego boundaries
Contemporary parallels:
- Humanitarian impulse
- Universal compassion
- Integrated prosocial development
- Peak experiences of unity

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Expansive love capacity
- Self-transcendent motivation
- Integration of care and wisdom
Secondary:
- Ego-based resistance
- Supportive community
- Progressive development
- Practical expression

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for expansive love that transcends self-interest while enhancing personal wholeness, manifesting as a stable tendency to recognize and actively support the flourishing of all beings. It represents the integration of deep wisdom with universal care, expressing the highest potential of human relationality.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the maturation of human love beyond its conditional forms into a stable, comprehensive care that encompasses both individual and universal dimensions. It operates as a transformative force that resolves the apparent contradiction between self-actualization and self-transcendence, creating a dynamic synthesis where personal development and universal care enhance each other. The quality combines clear perception of interconnection with active commitment to universal flourishing, manifesting as both insight and practical care.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous recognition of others' essential value and dignity
- Stable tendency to consider wider impact of actions
- Natural inclusion of others' wellbeing in decision-making
- Progressive expansion of circle of care and concern
- Integration of wisdom and warmth in relationships
- Practical expression through skillful beneficial action
- Development of both discriminating wisdom and universal acceptance

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive integration of understanding and care, transforming natural human capacity for love through expanded awareness and consistent cultivation. It begins with moments of natural caring and experiences of interconnection, developing through conscious practice into a stable disposition. The process involves both cognitive expansion (recognizing deeper interconnection) and affective development (cultivating inclusive care).

In practical terms, it manifests as a natural tendency to consider and support the wellbeing of an increasingly wide circle of beings. This occurs alongside growing skill in discerning and responding to needs appropriately. The quality enables sustained beneficial action without burnout by integrating self-care with universal care, wisdom with warmth, and personal development with service to others.

This universalization aims to:
- Preserve the transformative depth of caritas
- Make it accessible across cultural frameworks
- Maintain practical applicability
- Connect individual development to universal potential
- Describe observable manifestations
- Include both being and doing aspects

The description avoids:
- Religious-specific terminology
- Culture-bound concepts
- Abstract theoretical frameworks
- Purely individualistic or purely collective framing

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect or refine the description further?
