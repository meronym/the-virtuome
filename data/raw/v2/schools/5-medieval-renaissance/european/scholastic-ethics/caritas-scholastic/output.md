[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive integration of understanding and care, transforming natural human capacity for love through expanded awareness and consistent cultivation. It begins with moments of natural caring and experiences of interconnection, developing through conscious practice into a stable disposition. The process involves both cognitive expansion (recognizing deeper interconnection) and affective development (cultivating inclusive care).
