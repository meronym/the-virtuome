[Core Definition]
The cultivated capacity for disciplined learning that combines genuine curiosity with focused attention and wise discernment, enabling sustained and meaningful pursuit of knowledge while maintaining balance between intellectual enthusiasm and careful judgment.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the mature development of our natural desire to know and understand. It transforms raw curiosity into disciplined inquiry through the integration of enthusiasm and restraint, attention and discrimination. Unlike mere accumulation of information, it involves developing a refined relationship with knowledge itself - knowing what to learn, how to learn it, and why it matters.

This fundamentally human capacity combines cognitive, emotional, and volitional elements: the joy of discovery, the discipline of sustained attention, and the wisdom to direct our learning toward what is truly worth knowing. It operates as both an intellectual and moral quality, shaping not just what we know but how we grow through knowing.

[Manifestations]
- Sustained, focused attention in learning activities
- Balanced approach to information seeking and consumption
- Discriminating selection of learning priorities and sources
- Patient persistence in difficult intellectual tasks
- Integration of new knowledge with existing understanding
- Ethical approach to knowledge acquisition and use
- Recognition and respect for learning opportunities

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through three main mechanisms: it directs attention toward worthy objects of study, maintains engagement through difficulties and distractions, and guides the integration of new knowledge into meaningful understanding. It develops through practice in both focusing and restraining attention, learning to distinguish between essential and peripheral knowledge, and cultivating patience with the natural rhythm of deep learning.

In practical terms, it manifests as the capacity to maintain sustained study despite obstacles, to resist both intellectual laziness and scattered curiosity, and to pursue knowledge with both enthusiasm and discrimination. It enables lifelong learning by fostering a sustainable relationship with knowledge acquisition, preventing both burnout and superficiality while promoting depth and integration in learning.
