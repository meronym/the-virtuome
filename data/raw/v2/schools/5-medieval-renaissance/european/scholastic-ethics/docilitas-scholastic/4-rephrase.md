Let me follow the analytical process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Receptive learning capacity
Key functions:
- Active openness to knowledge/wisdom
- Recognition of learning opportunities
- Balanced self-assessment
- Progressive development capacity
Systemic role: Enables ongoing growth and development

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Learning from others
- Personal growth through guidance
- Recognition of knowledge gaps
- Development through feedback
Contemporary relevance:
- Lifelong learning
- Professional development
- Mentorship relationships
- Innovation adoption

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary elements:
- Receptive awareness
- Active engagement
- Growth orientation
- Balanced humility
Secondary elements:
- Ego resistance
- Trust development
- Feedback integration
- Knowledge synthesis

Now, following the output format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The cultivated capacity to remain genuinely open to learning and growth through active receptivity to wisdom, experience, and guidance. It combines clear recognition of one's knowledge limitations with the sustained willingness to learn from any source that might offer genuine insight or understanding.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the developed ability to maintain an optimal learning stance toward experience and understanding. It manifests as a dynamic balance between receptivity and active engagement, combining intellectual humility with the courage to grow. Unlike passive compliance or mere absorption of information, it involves discriminating openness and the capacity to integrate new insights with existing understanding while maintaining both critical awareness and genuine receptivity.

[Manifestations]
- Sustained curiosity coupled with disciplined attention
- Recognition and acknowledgment of knowledge gaps
- Active seeking of feedback and guidance
- Integration of multiple perspectives and sources of wisdom
- Balanced self-assessment and growth orientation
- Practical application of learned insights
- Development of increasingly refined learning capacity

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous interplay between receptivity and integration. It begins with recognition of learning opportunities, moves through active engagement with new understanding, and culminates in the integration of insights into both knowledge and behavior. The process is supported by maintained awareness of knowledge limitations and sustained openness to growth, while being regulated by discriminating judgment about what is valuable to learn.

In practice, this quality enables ongoing personal and professional development through multiple channels. It manifests in the ability to learn effectively from experience, feedback, formal instruction, and observation, while maintaining both critical thinking and genuine openness. This creates a progressive spiral of development where each learning experience enhances the capacity for further growth and understanding.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Yes - learning receptivity is universal
2. Depth preservation: Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear behavioral manifestations
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - links personal development to universal learning capacity
5. Development clarity: Yes - shows progressive nature of capacity
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - concrete behavioral indicators

The description maintains the sophistication of the scholastic concept while making it accessible and relevant to contemporary contexts. It preserves the essential dynamic between receptivity and active engagement while showing practical applications across different domains of life.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
