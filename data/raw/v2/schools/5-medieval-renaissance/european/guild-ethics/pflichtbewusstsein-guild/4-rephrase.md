Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The conscious integration of responsibility into one's identity and way of being, manifesting as an internal compass that guides behavior through awareness of obligations to self, others, and larger systems. This quality transforms external standards and duties into internalized principles that shape decisions and actions.

[Essential Nature]
Responsibility-consciousness represents the development of an ever-present awareness of how one's actions affect broader systems and communities. It transcends mere rule-following to become an active orientation toward excellence and service. This quality bridges individual agency with collective needs, creating a natural alignment between personal conduct and communal wellbeing.

At its mature stage, it manifests as an intuitive grasp of what situations require, combining practical wisdom with ethical awareness. This enables both proactive responsibility-taking and appropriate response to emerging needs, while maintaining high standards in all endeavors.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent attention to quality and detail in work without external supervision
- Natural anticipation of needs and potential issues within one's sphere of influence
- Balanced consideration of multiple stakeholders in decision-making
- Proactive maintenance of standards and systems
- Integration of professional excellence with social responsibility
- Sustained commitment to long-term collective wellbeing
- Development from rule-following to principle-based action

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive internalization of external standards and responsibilities, transforming them from perceived obligations into natural expressions of professional and personal identity. It operates by maintaining constant awareness of interconnected responsibilities while developing intuitive understanding of appropriate action. The process involves continuous refinement of judgment through experience and reflection.

In practice, it enables reliable self-regulation and consistent high-quality performance without external oversight. It creates natural alignment between individual conduct and collective needs, fostering trust-based relationships and sustainable systems. This quality supports both personal excellence and social cohesion, making it fundamental to professional and civic life.

- Maintains connection to practical professional contexts
- Highlights developmental aspects
- Shows relevance across cultures and contexts
- Connects individual to collective dimensions
- Emphasizes observable manifestations
- Retains sophistication while using accessible language

Would you like me to adjust any aspects of this universalization?
