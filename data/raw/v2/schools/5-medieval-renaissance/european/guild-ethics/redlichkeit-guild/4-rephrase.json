CORE PRINCIPLES\nThe guild system was fundamentally about:\n- Transmission of professional excellence\n- Building character through craft\n- Maintaining social order through professional organization\n- Creating meaning through work\n- Balancing individual and collective interests\n\n2. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS\nWhat made guild ethics distinct was:\n- Integration of practical and moral excellence\n- Systematic character formation through work\n- Community-embedded professional identity\n- Multi-generational knowledge transmission\n- Balance of tradition and innovation\n\n3. HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE\nThe virtues should reflect the developmental journey:\n- Apprentice: learning foundational virtues\n- Journeyman: developing professional autonomy\n- Master: achieving full moral and technical maturity\n\n4. INTERCONNECTED DIMENSIONS\nThe virtues operated across multiple spheres:\n- Technical (craft excellence)\n- Social (community relations)\n- Moral (personal character)\n- Economic (business ethics)\n- Spiritual (meaning in work)\n\n5. HISTORICAL IMPACT\nThe most enduring aspects that influenced later professional ethics:\n- Professional responsibility\n- Mentorship obligations\n- Quality standards\n- Community service\n- Collective wisdom\n\nBased on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of the most representative virtues:\n\nCORE GUILD VIRTUES:\n\n1. MEISTERSCHAFT (Mastery)\n- Technical excellence combined with moral maturity\n- The ultimate integration of skill and character\n- Foundation for teaching and leadership\n\n2. TREUE (Loyalty/Fidelity)\n- To craft tradition\n- To guild community\n- To professional standards\n- Multi-directional commitment\n\n3.

Operation/mechanism (75-100 words)\n2. Practical expression/impact (75-100 words)\n```\n\nQUALITY CRITERIA:\n1. Comprehensiveness:\n- Captures full depth of original concept\n- Addresses multiple dimensions (personal/interpersonal/universal)\n- Includes both theoretical and practical aspects\n\n2. Accessibility:\n- Understandable without specialized knowledge\n- Relatable to common experience\n- Practical and applicable\n\n3. Precision:\n- Clear differentiation from related concepts\n- Specific rather than vague descriptions\n- Accurate to original meaning\n\n4. Relevance:\n- Contemporary applications clear\n- Universal human significance evident\n- Practical value apparent\n\nVERIFICATION QUESTIONS:\n1. Would this description be meaningful across cultures?\n2. Does it preserve the depth of the original concept?\n3. Is it practically applicable?\n4. Does it connect individual to universal aspects?\n5. Is it clear how this quality develops?\n6. Are the manifestations observable/verifiable?\n\nUPDATED SCOPE: Please focus on the following virtue: Redlichkeit. Follow the provided preparation instructions, composition guidelines, and output format to create a universal language description of the virtue."
