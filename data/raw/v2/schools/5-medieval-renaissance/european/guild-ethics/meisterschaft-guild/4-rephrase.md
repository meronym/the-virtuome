Here's my attempt at a universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The integration of technical excellence with personal wisdom, manifesting as the mature capacity to perform, understand, teach, and advance a domain of human endeavor while embodying its highest principles and fostering its development in others. This mastery unites practical skill, deeper understanding, and ethical responsibility.

[Essential Nature]
Mastery represents the fullest development of human capability within a specific domain, transcending mere technical proficiency to encompass wisdom, judgment, and leadership. It emerges through prolonged dedicated practice combined with ethical development and deepening understanding. This quality integrates practical expertise with moral maturity, enabling both preservation and advancement of human achievement while fostering growth in others.

At its core, mastery embodies the union of doing, knowing, and being - where technical excellence, deep understanding, and personal character become inseparable. It represents not just the apex of skill, but the capacity to embody and transmit the wisdom of a discipline.

[Manifestations]
- Effortless technical execution combined with profound understanding
- Balanced judgment in complex situations drawing from deep experience
- Natural leadership through example and earned authority
- Capacity to adapt knowledge to new contexts while preserving essential principles
- Ability to foster growth in others through personalized guidance
- Integration of practical skill with ethical wisdom
- Innovation that honors and advances tradition

[Functional Description]
Mastery develops through a spiral of practice, reflection, and responsibility. Technical skill grows alongside deeper understanding, while increasing responsibility demands character development. This integration occurs through sustained engagement with real challenges, mentorship relationships, and progressive assumption of teaching and leadership roles. Each dimension - practical, cognitive, and ethical - reinforces and elevates the others.

In practice, mastery manifests as consistently excellent performance combined with the ability to nurture excellence in others. Masters serve as both guardians and innovators within their domains, maintaining standards while adapting to change. Their presence creates an environment that encourages growth, their example inspires achievement, and their guidance helps others navigate both technical and ethical challenges. The master's influence extends beyond individual interactions to shape the development of their entire field.
