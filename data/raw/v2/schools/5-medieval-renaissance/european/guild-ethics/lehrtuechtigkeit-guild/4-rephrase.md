Let me analyze and transform Lehrtüchtigkeit following the outlined process.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Developmental stewardship
Key functions:
- Knowledge transmission
- Character formation
- Skill cultivation
- Cultural preservation
- Professional lineage maintenance

Systemic roles:
- Intergenerational continuity
- Quality standards maintenance
- Community cohesion
- Professional evolution
- Social reproduction

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Mentorship relationships
- Skill acquisition
- Personal growth
- Knowledge inheritance
- Mastery development

Contemporary parallels:
- Professional development
- Educational leadership
- Cultural transmission
- Organizational learning
- Skill mastery

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Developmental stewardship is the capacity to guide others' growth through the integrated transmission of knowledge, skill, and wisdom. It combines technical expertise, interpersonal awareness, and ethical responsibility in fostering the comprehensive development of those under one's guidance while preserving and advancing collective knowledge.

[Essential Nature]
Developmental stewardship operates at the intersection of mastery and nurture, embodying the responsibility of those who have achieved proficiency to cultivate it in others. This quality transcends mere instruction, encompassing the holistic cultivation of capability, character, and consciousness in learners. It requires deep understanding of both subject matter and human development, allowing the steward to adapt guidance to individual needs while maintaining connection to broader traditions and standards of excellence.

[Manifestations]
Technical Dimension:
- Clear demonstration of complex skills
- Systematic knowledge structuring
- Progressive challenge calibration
- Error pattern recognition
- Effective feedback delivery

Interpersonal Dimension:
- Attunement to learner readiness
- Motivation cultivation
- Trust building
- Progress pacing
- Emotional support

Developmental Dimension:
- Character formation guidance
- Professional identity cultivation
- Ethical awareness building
- Independence fostering
- Excellence standard setting

[Functional Description]
Developmental stewardship operates through a dynamic interplay of demonstration, guidance, and progressive autonomy-granting. The steward maintains a delicate balance between supporting growth and challenging comfort zones, continuously adjusting their approach based on the learner's development while maintaining clear standards of excellence. This requires simultaneous attention to technical, personal, and ethical dimensions of development.

In practice, this quality manifests as an ongoing dialogue between steward and learner, where explicit instruction combines with implicit modeling. The steward creates conditions for growth through structured experiences, timely feedback, and graduated challenges, while modeling the integration of skill, wisdom, and character they seek to develop in others. This relationship evolves from direct guidance toward collaborative exploration as the learner develops.

This universalized description:
1. Maintains the depth of the guild concept of Lehrtüchtigkeit
2. Makes it accessible across cultural contexts
3. Preserves practical applicability
4. Connects individual development to collective advancement
5. Shows clear developmental progression
6. Provides observable manifestations
7. Retains sophisticated understanding of teaching/learning dynamics
8. Emphasizes both technical and character development aspects

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the stated objectives?
