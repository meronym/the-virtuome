Let me follow the process systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Collective consciousness manifesting as active care for community welfare
Key functions:
- Binds individuals into coherent social whole
- Enables collective action and mutual support
- Creates shared responsibility and identity
- Facilitates intergenerational continuity

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Belonging to something larger than self
- Mutual dependence and support
- Collective achievement and celebration
- Shared responsibility for common good

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Active awareness of collective identity
- Practical manifestation of mutual care
- Progressive development from self to collective
- Systemic reinforcement through shared practices

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The conscious awareness and active expression of our inherent interconnectedness, manifesting as practical care for collective wellbeing. It is the capacity to experience and act from a sense of meaningful belonging to a larger whole, combining personal responsibility with collective identity.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the mature development of social consciousness, where individual identity expands to encompass genuine care for collective welfare. It transcends mere group membership or social obligation, emerging as an authentic recognition of shared destiny and mutual dependence. This recognition naturally manifests as practical action for common good, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of individual contribution and collective flourishing.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous assistance to others without expectation of return
- Active participation in maintaining community standards and welfare
- Natural inclination to consider collective impact of personal choices
- Willing contribution to shared resources and common projects
- Experience of personal fulfillment through group achievement
- Protection and transmission of collective wisdom and resources
- Integration of individual excellence with community benefit

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive expansion of self-awareness beyond individual boundaries, cultivated through practical participation in collective endeavors. Initial experiences of belonging and mutual support create positive feedback loops, gradually transforming external social obligations into internal motivations. The mature expression combines clear individual identity with genuine experience of collective consciousness.

In practice, it manifests as natural care for community welfare, expressed through daily choices and actions that balance personal and collective benefit. It creates resilient social fabric through networks of mutual support, enabling both individual flourishing and collective achievement. This quality becomes especially visible during challenges, where individual resources are spontaneously mobilized for collective benefit.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the deep understanding of collective consciousness from guild ethics
2. Translates medieval professional context to universal human experience
3. Maintains practical focus on observable behaviors
4. Links individual development to collective benefit
5. Emphasizes active expression rather than passive membership
6. Connects to contemporary needs for community resilience

The description should be:
- Meaningful across cultures (addresses universal human experiences)
- True to original depth (preserves sophisticated understanding of collective consciousness)
- Practically applicable (focuses on observable behaviors and development)
- Bridge individual/universal (shows clear connection between personal and collective)
- Developmentally clear (describes progression from basic to mature expression)
- Verifiable (through observable manifestations and impacts)

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universalization?
