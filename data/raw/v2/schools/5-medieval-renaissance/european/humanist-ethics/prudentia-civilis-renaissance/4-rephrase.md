Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Prudentia Civilis:

Core principle: Integration of practical wisdom with social responsibility
Key functions:
- Decision-making in complex social contexts
- Balancing competing interests
- Foreseeing consequences
- Determining appropriate action
- Serving collective good

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Community leadership
- Collective decision-making
- Social problem-solving
- Public responsibility
- Ethical governance

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS completed

Now, here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to understand, navigate, and positively influence complex social systems through a combination of practical wisdom, ethical judgment, and concern for collective wellbeing. It enables effective decision-making that considers both immediate circumstances and long-term consequences for the community.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the mature integration of social intelligence, ethical discernment, and practical capability in service of collective flourishing. It combines keen observation of social dynamics with deep understanding of human nature and systems thinking. Unlike pure technical expertise or abstract moral theory, it manifests as the practical wisdom to navigate complex social realities while maintaining ethical integrity and fostering community welfare.

This capacity develops through the intersection of experience, reflection, and genuine concern for others, enabling one to perceive multiple layers of social reality simultaneously - from immediate interpersonal dynamics to broader systemic implications.

[Manifestations]
- Ability to anticipate the cascading effects of decisions across social networks
- Skill in finding solutions that address multiple stakeholder needs simultaneously
- Capacity to identify root causes of social challenges beneath surface symptoms
- Talent for building consensus and fostering collaborative problem-solving
- Pattern recognition in social dynamics and system behaviors
- Integration of ethical principles with practical necessities
- Balance between immediate needs and long-term community welfare

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through continuous integration of multiple processing streams: social perception, pattern recognition, ethical evaluation, and practical judgment. It involves maintaining simultaneous awareness of immediate situations and broader contexts, while processing both analytical and intuitive inputs. The capacity grows through cycles of observation, action, and reflection, gradually building an embodied understanding of social dynamics and effective intervention points.

In practice, it manifests as the ability to guide groups through complex challenges while maintaining social cohesion and ethical integrity. This includes identifying key leverage points for positive change, building necessary support for initiatives, anticipating and addressing potential problems, and maintaining focus on long-term collective benefit rather than just immediate gains. It enables leadership that is both effective and ethical, practical and principled.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the sophisticated integration of practical and ethical elements
2. Maintains connection to concrete social reality
3. Makes the concept accessible without specialized knowledge
4. Highlights developmental aspects
5. Emphasizes observable manifestations
6. Connects individual capacity to collective benefit

The description meets key criteria by:
- Using phenomenological rather than theoretical language
- Emphasizing observable manifestations
- Maintaining philosophical sophistication
- Ensuring practical applicability
- Connecting individual to universal aspects

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural relevance ✓ (focuses on universal social dynamics)
2. Depth preservation ✓ (maintains sophistication of original concept)
3. Practical applicability ✓ (clear behavioral manifestations)
4. Individual-universal connection ✓ (links personal capacity to collective benefit)
5. Developmental clarity ✓ (explains growth process)
6. Observable manifestations ✓ (concrete behavioral indicators)

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
