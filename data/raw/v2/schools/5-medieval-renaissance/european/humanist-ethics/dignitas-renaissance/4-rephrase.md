Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF DIGNITAS
Core principle: Inherent human worth and potential for excellence
Functions: Self-actualization, moral development, creative expression
Systemic role: Foundation for human rights, ethical behavior, personal growth
Developmental aspects: Progressive realization of human potential

2. UNIVERSALIZATION
Universal experiences: Self-awareness, sense of worth, drive for growth
Parallel concepts: Human rights, personal sovereignty, self-actualization
Contemporary relevance: Personal development, human rights, ethical leadership
Timeless patterns: Recognition of human potential, moral agency, self-determination

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary Elements:
- Essential nature: Inherent human worth and potential
- Manifestations: Self-respect, ethical behavior, creative expression
- Development: Growing awareness and actualization of potential
- Relationships: Foundation for other virtues and human development

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The innate quality of human worth and potential that manifests as self-aware consciousness, moral agency, and the capacity for growth and self-determination. It encompasses both the inherent value present in every human being and the dynamic potential for development and excellence.

[Essential Nature]
Human dignity represents the fundamental characteristic of conscious existence that enables self-reflection, moral choice, and creative expression. It functions as both an inherent quality and a developmental potential, serving as the foundation for personal growth, ethical behavior, and meaningful achievement. This quality exists independently of external circumstances while simultaneously providing the impetus for its own fuller expression through conscious development.

[Manifestations]
- Self-aware recognition of one's inherent worth and potential
- Exercise of moral choice and ethical decision-making
- Creative expression and contribution to human knowledge
- Responsible use of personal freedom and agency
- Development of capacities through conscious effort
- Respect for the dignity of others
- Leadership that upholds human worth

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through the interplay of awareness and action, where recognition of inherent worth creates the foundation for conscious development. It manifests first as an intuitive sense of self-worth, then develops through reflection and choice into an active force for personal growth and ethical behavior. The awareness of dignity creates responsibility for its expression, leading to a self-reinforcing cycle of development.

In practical terms, this quality guides personal conduct, shapes relationships, and influences all aspects of human development. It supports ethical decision-making, motivates personal growth, and fosters respect for others' inherent worth. This creates a framework for both individual achievement and harmonious social interaction, serving as a cornerstone for human rights, personal development, and ethical leadership.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the Renaissance concept's depth while making it accessible
2. Connects individual experience to universal human potential
3. Maintains both philosophical sophistication and practical applicability
4. Links inherent worth with dynamic development
5. Provides observable manifestations and clear developmental trajectory
6. Makes contemporary relevance explicit

The description successfully:
- Uses phenomenological rather than theoretical language
- Balances precision with accessibility
- Connects abstract principles to concrete manifestations
- Progressive builds complexity
- Maintains cross-cultural relevance
- Preserves practical applicability

Would you like me to further develop any aspect of this universalization or apply this process to another virtue from our list?
