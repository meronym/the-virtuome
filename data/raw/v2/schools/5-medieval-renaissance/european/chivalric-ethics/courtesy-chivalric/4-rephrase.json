      "content": "Let me think through this systematically.\n\nANALYTICAL APPROACH:\n1. Core Considerations:\n- Which virtues appear most frequently in primary sources?\n- Which virtues are treated as foundational or generative of others?\n- Which virtues uniquely characterize chivalric ethics vs. other medieval virtue systems?\n- Which virtues bridge multiple domains (martial, spiritual, social)?\n\n2. Historical Development:\nThe chivalric tradition evolved from primarily martial origins to incorporate:\n- Christian religious elements\n- Courtly social refinements\n- Literary/romantic ideals\nThis suggests we need virtues representing each developmental layer while focusing on those that achieved synthesis.\n\n3. Practical Impact:\nThe most essential virtues should:\n- Guide both practical conduct and ideal aspiration\n- Bridge internal character and external behavior\n- Apply across multiple contexts (battlefield, court, private life)\n- Support both individual excellence and social harmony\n\n4. Cultural Distinctiveness:\nThe uniquely chivalric contribution to virtue ethics lies in:\n- Synthesis of warrior ethics with Christian morality\n- Integration of martial prowess with social refinement\n- Balance of strength with gentleness\n- Combination of practical skill with moral excellence\n\n5. Legacy and Influence:\nThe most enduring virtues were those that:\n- Transcended their historical context\n- Influenced later ethical traditions\n- Remained relevant to personal development\n- Offered universal human insights\n\nBased on this analysis, I propose the following shortlist as most representative:\n\nCORE CHIVALRIC VIRTUES:\n\n1. PROWESS (Prouesse)\n- Represents excellence in action\n- Combines physical skill with moral purpose\n- Foundation for earning right to exercise other virtues\n\n2. HONOR (Honneur)\n- Integrates personal integrity with social reputation\n- Links individual conscience with communal standards\n- Central to chivalric self-regulation\n\n3. COURTESY (Courtoisie)\n- Elevates strength through refinement\n- Bridges martial and social virtues\n- Humanizes power through grace\n\n4. LOYALTY (Loyaut\u00e9)\n- Structures relationships and obligations\n- Provides framework for service\n- Balances individual excellence with social duty\n\n5. LARGESSE\n- Demonstrates nobility through generosity\n- Links material power with moral responsibility\n- Practical expression of social virtue\n\n6. FRANCHISE\n- Represents noble-minded authenticity\n- Combines freedom with responsibility\n- Balances power with ethical constraint\n\n7. MESURE\n- Controls and directs other virtues\n- Provides wisdom in application\n- Balances competing demands\n\n8. PREUDOMME\n- Represents integrated excellence\n- Combines experience with wisdom\n- Ultimate goal of chivalric development\n\nThis shortlist:\n- Covers major domains (martial, social, moral)\n- Includes both practical and aspirational virtues\n- Represents different stages of tradition's development\n- Maintains internal relationships between virtues\n- Captures distinctive chivalric synthesis\n\nWould you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML+Markdown nodes for these eight core virtues?"

Initial Concept Analysis\n- Identify the virtue's core principle/phenomenon\n- List key functions and manifestations\n- Note relationship patterns and systemic roles\n- Map developmental aspects\n\n2. Universalization Process\n- Identify universal human experiences it relates to\n- Find parallel concepts across contexts\n- Note contemporary relevance/applications\n- Identify timeless patterns/principles\n\n3. Structural Analysis\nPrimary Elements:\n- Essential nature/core function\n- Observable manifestations\n- Developmental trajectory\n- Systemic relationships\n\nSecondary Elements:\n- Common obstacles/challenges\n- Supporting conditions\n- Related qualities\n- Practical applications\n\nCOMPOSITION GUIDELINES:\n1. Language:\n- Use phenomenological rather than theoretical language\n- Prefer experiential descriptions over abstract concepts\n- Balance precision with accessibility\n- Avoid culture-specific references\n\n2. Structure:\n- Start with clearest, most fundamental aspect\n- Build complexity progressively\n- Connect abstract principles to concrete manifestations\n- Link individual to universal aspects\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```markdown\n[Core Definition]\nSingle paragraph capturing fundamental essence\n(50-75 words)\n\n[Essential Nature]\nDeeper elaboration of the quality's nature and function\n(100-150 words)\n\n[Manifestations]\n- Observable expressions (4-7 bullet points)\n- Developmental aspects\n- Practical implementations\n- Relationship patterns\n\n[Functional Description]\nHow this quality operates and develops in human experience\nTwo paragraphs:\n1. Operation/mechanism (75-100 words)\n2. Practical expression/impact (75-100 words)\n```\n\nQUALITY CRITERIA:\n1. Comprehensiveness:\n- Captures full depth of original concept\n- Addresses multiple dimensions (personal/interpersonal/universal)\n- Includes both theoretical and practical aspects\n\n2. Accessibility:\n- Understandable without specialized knowledge\n- Relatable to common experience\n- Practical and applicable\n\n3. Precision:\n- Clear differentiation from related concepts\n- Specific rather than vague descriptions\n- Accurate to original meaning\n\n4. Relevance:\n- Contemporary applications clear\n- Universal human significance evident\n- Practical value apparent\n\nVERIFICATION QUESTIONS:\n1. Would this description be meaningful across cultures?\n2. Does it preserve the depth of the original concept?\n3. Is it practically applicable?\n4. Does it connect individual to universal aspects?\n5. Is it clear how this quality develops?\n6. Are the manifestations observable/verifiable?\n\nUPDATED SCOPE: Please focus on the following virtue: Courtoisie. Follow the provided preparation instructions, composition guidelines, and output format to create a universal language description of the virtue."
