Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The cultivation and expression of refined awareness in social interaction, manifesting as the artful balance of authentic self-expression with sensitivity to others, creating spaces of mutual dignity through graceful conduct and conscious consideration.

[Essential Nature]
At its heart, this quality represents the human capacity to elevate social interaction from mere functional exchange to an art form that honors both self and other. It emerges from the integration of external awareness with internal refinement, creating a dynamic balance between form and authenticity. This quality transforms raw social power into cultivated influence, replacing crude force with elegant effectiveness.

Beyond mere politeness or etiquette, it embodies the sophisticated understanding that genuine consideration for others enhances rather than diminishes personal power, while conscious refinement of social interaction creates spaces where both individual expression and collective harmony can flourish.

[Manifestations]
- Graceful navigation of social complexity without visible strain
- Natural attunement to others' comfort and dignity
- Elegant self-expression that uplifts rather than dominates
- Creation of psychological safety through conscious consideration
- Transformation of potential conflict into harmonious exchange
- Elevation of ordinary interactions through artistic attention
- Balance of authentic expression with appropriate form

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through heightened awareness of social dynamics combined with cultivated responsiveness. It begins with conscious attention to form and effect but develops into intuitive grace through dedicated practice. The initial focus on external forms gradually transforms into genuine insight into human dignity and social harmony, leading to natural expression that requires no conscious effort.

In practice, this quality manifests as the ability to create spaces where people feel simultaneously at ease and elevated. It enables complex social coordination without friction, transforms potential tensions into opportunities for connection, and allows power to express itself through grace rather than force. The result is social interaction that satisfies both practical needs and human dignity.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the sophisticated understanding of social refinement central to courtoisie
2. Translates medieval court context to universal human experience
3. Maintains connection between external form and internal development
4. Emphasizes practical manifestation while preserving philosophical depth
5. Links individual cultivation to social harmony
6. Provides observable criteria for development
7. Connects to contemporary social needs and challenges

The description should be meaningful across cultures while maintaining the essential insights of the original chivalric virtue. It emphasizes observable manifestations and practical development while preserving the deeper philosophical understanding of how refined social interaction contributes to human flourishing.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
