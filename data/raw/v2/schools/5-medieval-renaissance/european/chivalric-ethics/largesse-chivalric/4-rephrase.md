Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Resourceful generosity aligned with capacity and role
Functions: 
- Social bonding through material sharing
- Demonstrating worthiness through giving
- Supporting community through resource distribution
- Balancing abundance with responsibility
Systemic role:
- Creates social cohesion
- Establishes reciprocal obligations
- Demonstrates leadership through support
- Maintains social harmony through distribution

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING
Universal experiences:
- Sharing resources
- Supporting others
- Managing abundance
- Expressing care through giving
Contemporary parallels:

- Social responsibility
- Resource stewardship
- Community support

3. STRUCTURAL SYNTHESIS
Core aspects:
- Generous orientation
- Responsible distribution
- Capacity-aligned giving
- Community nurturing

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The virtue of generous stewardship that combines abundance with responsibility, expressing itself through appropriate sharing of resources, capabilities, and opportunities in ways that nurture both individual and collective flourishing. It manifests as the natural overflow of developed capacity into beneficial action.

[Essential Nature]
Generosity of capacity represents the mature expression of abundance, where the development of resources, skills, or influence naturally flows outward to benefit others and strengthen the broader community. Unlike simple giving, it embodies a sophisticated understanding of appropriate distribution that matches resources to needs, timing to readiness, and support to capability. This virtue bridges individual excellence with social responsibility, transforming personal capacity into collective benefit.

[Manifestations]
- Sharing material resources in ways that empower rather than create dependency
- Offering knowledge, skills, and experience to support others' development
- Creating opportunities that allow others to develop their own capabilities
- Maintaining sustainable balance between building and sharing resources
- Demonstrating leadership through responsible resource stewardship
- Supporting initiatives that strengthen community resilience
- Expressing care through thoughtful and timely provision

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a sophisticated awareness of resource flows, combining discernment of appropriate timing and scale with understanding of recipient readiness and community needs. It develops through progressive mastery of resource management, moving from simple sharing to strategic stewardship that creates lasting positive impact. The mature expression involves maintaining dynamic balance between building capacity and sharing benefits.

In practice, it manifests as a natural orientation toward supporting others' growth and community development through appropriate sharing of whatever resources one has cultivated. This ranges from material support to sharing of knowledge, opportunities, and connections. Success is measured not by quantity given but by the sustainable positive impact created through thoughtful distribution aligned with genuine needs and development potential.
```

This universalization preserves the sophisticated medieval understanding of largesse as more than simple generosity, while making it accessible and relevant to modern contexts. It maintains the connection between individual excellence and social responsibility while eliminating culture-specific assumptions about nobility or social class.

The description emphasizes observable behaviors and developmental aspects while connecting individual practice to broader social impact. It provides clear guidance for practical application while preserving the philosophical depth of the original concept.

Would you like me to revise any aspect to better meet the specified criteria?
