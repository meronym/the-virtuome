[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a sophisticated awareness of resource flows, combining discernment of appropriate timing and scale with understanding of recipient readiness and community needs. It develops through progressive mastery of resource management, moving from simple sharing to strategic stewardship that creates lasting positive impact. The mature expression involves maintaining dynamic balance between building capacity and sharing benefits.

In practice, it manifests as a natural orientation toward supporting others' growth and community development through appropriate sharing of whatever resources one has cultivated.
