Here's the universal language description following the requested format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The integration of noble character with practical service, where personal development and spiritual aspiration express themselves through ethical action and social benefit. It represents the maturation of individual strength into a force for positive social transformation, combining moral courage with humble service.

[Essential Nature]
Noble character (Futuwwah) emerges when individual development aligns with social benefit, creating a dynamic synthesis of personal power and collective service. It manifests as a practical spiritual chivalry, where inner refinement naturally expresses through beneficial action, and where strength finds its highest expression in service to others.

This quality represents the marriage of power with responsibility, courage with compassion, and individual excellence with social contribution. It transforms personal capabilities into vehicles for collective benefit, while simultaneously using service as a path for individual growth and spiritual development.

[Manifestations]
- Moral courage expressed through protective action for the vulnerable
- Generous service performed with humility and discretion
- Leadership that empowers others while diminishing ego
- Strength and capability dedicated to collective benefit
- Personal excellence expressed through social contribution
- Individual development pursued through service to others
- Spiritual aspiration manifested in practical ethical action

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous feedback loop between individual development and social contribution. As one develops personal capabilities, these naturally seek expression through service; as one serves, this activity becomes a vehicle for deeper personal transformation. The process creates an upward spiral where individual excellence and social benefit reinforce each other, transforming both self and society.

In practical terms, this manifests as ethical leadership, mentorship, community service, and social entrepreneurship. It appears wherever individual capability meets social need with ethical intention. The quality develops through conscious practice of linking personal growth with social contribution, gradually maturing from simple acts of service into a comprehensive way of being that naturally transforms both individual and environment.

This universalized description aims to:
- Capture the essence of Futuwwah without cultural-specific references
- Maintain its sophisticated integration of personal and social dimensions
- Preserve its practical orientation while expressing its spiritual depth
- Make it accessible and applicable across cultural contexts
- Retain its transformative potential

Would you like me to revise any aspect to better meet the objectives?
