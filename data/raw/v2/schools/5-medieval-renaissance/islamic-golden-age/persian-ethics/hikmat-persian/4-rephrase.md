Here's the universal description following the requested format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to discern and implement right action through the integration of deep understanding, practical experience, and ethical awareness. It manifests as the ability to grasp the essence of situations, recognize underlying patterns, and respond with appropriate, timely, and beneficial action.

[Essential Nature]
Practical wisdom represents the marriage of understanding and action, where knowledge transforms into skillful living. It emerges from the integration of theoretical comprehension, experiential learning, and ethical insight, enabling one to perceive both the immediate and deeper dimensions of situations. This quality combines clarity of perception with soundness of judgment, allowing for responses that address both immediate circumstances and longer-term implications.

[Manifestations]
- Clear discernment in complex situations, seeing both surface details and deeper patterns
- Balanced judgment that considers multiple perspectives and implications
- Timely and appropriate action that addresses both immediate needs and long-term effects
- Natural authority that emerges from demonstrated good judgment
- Ability to articulate deep insights in accessible ways
- Consistent good decision-making across varied contexts
- Integration of theoretical knowledge with practical experience

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the continuous interplay of learning and application, where theoretical understanding meets practical challenge. It grows through reflection on experience, integration of lessons learned, and increasingly subtle perception of patterns and principles. Each challenge becomes an opportunity for deeper understanding, while each insight finds its validation in practical application.

In daily life, it manifests as the capacity to navigate complex situations with clarity and effectiveness. This includes making sound decisions in uncertainty, offering guidance that illuminates rather than directs, and taking actions that address immediate needs while serving longer-term good. It enables one to teach through example, lead through understanding, and serve through wisdom.

This universalized description aims to:
1. Preserve the sophisticated integration of knowledge and action central to Hikmat
2. Make the concept accessible without cultural-specific references
3. Maintain practical applicability
4. Connect individual development to universal principles
5. Detail observable manifestations
6. Outline clear developmental patterns

The description should resonate across cultures while maintaining the depth and sophistication of the original Persian-Islamic concept. It emphasizes both personal development and practical application, making it relevant to contemporary contexts while preserving the essential wisdom of the tradition.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the stated objectives?
