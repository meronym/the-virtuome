Let me follow the process step by step for Ikhlas:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Pure, undivided authenticity of intention and action
Key functions:
- Alignment of inner state with outer action
- Purification of motivations
- Integration of being and doing
- Resolution of internal conflicts
Systemic role: Creates coherence between inner and outer dimensions of experience

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Desire for authentic self-expression
- Internal conflict between different motivations
- Quest for integrity between thought and action
- Experience of genuine vs performative behavior
Contemporary applications:
- Personal development
- Professional ethics
- Authentic leadership
- Mental health and well-being

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Undivided attention and intention
- Alignment of all aspects of self
- Progressive refinement of motivation
- Integration of thought, feeling, and action

Based on this analysis, here's the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of undivided authenticity that emerges when all aspects of one's being align in complete coherence, resulting in actions that flow from pure intention without internal conflict or external distortion. It represents the integration of thought, feeling, and action in their most refined and genuine form.

[Essential Nature]
Authentic coherence manifests when the layers of self - from deepest motivation to external expression - align without contradiction or interference. This quality develops through progressive refinement of intention and increasing awareness of internal states, leading to actions that emerge from one's whole being rather than fragmented or competing motivations.

This refinement process naturally eliminates the gap between inner experience and outer expression, creating a state where action flows from essence rather than calculation, and where being and doing become unified rather than separate operations.

[Manifestations]
- Actions that arise spontaneously from deep understanding rather than rules or expectations
- Communication that reflects genuine inner state without social filtering
- Decision-making characterized by clarity and absence of internal conflict
- Relationships based on transparent authenticity rather than managed impressions
- Creative expression that emerges directly from essence rather than technique
- Professional conduct aligned with personal values and universal principles
- Service motivated by direct recognition of need rather than external reward

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous process of internal clarification, where competing motivations and fragmented aspects of self gradually resolve into unified coherence. It develops through increasing awareness of subtle internal states and their relationship to external action, leading to progressive alignment of all dimensions of experience.

In practical expression, this manifests as a natural authenticity that others recognize and trust, creating relationships and outcomes characterized by genuine value rather than superficial effectiveness. It enables action that is simultaneously spontaneous and appropriate, emerging from deep understanding rather than calculated response, and serving universal rather than merely personal purposes.

This universalized description:
1. Maintains the essential depth of the Islamic concept of Ikhlas
2. Makes it accessible to those without religious/cultural context
3. Preserves its practical applicability
4. Connects individual experience to universal principles
5. Shows clear developmental trajectory
6. Provides observable manifestations

The description emphasizes the phenomenological experience and practical manifestations while preserving the sophisticated understanding of human development implicit in the original concept. It translates the spiritual insight of the tradition into universal psychological and philosophical language without losing its essential meaning.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this description?
