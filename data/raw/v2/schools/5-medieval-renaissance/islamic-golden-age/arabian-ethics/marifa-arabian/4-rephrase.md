Let me analyze Ma'rifa systematically before composing the universal description.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Direct experiential knowing/understanding
Key functions:
- Integration of intellectual and intuitive knowledge
- Direct perception of reality/truth
- Transformation of consciousness
- Deepening of understanding through experience
Systemic role: Bridge between theoretical and experiential knowledge

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Moments of profound understanding
- Direct intuitive knowing
- Integration of learning with experience
- Deepening wisdom through life experience
- Transformative insights

STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Direct experiential understanding
- Integration of multiple ways of knowing
- Progressive deepening of insight
- Transformation of perspective

Secondary:
- Practice and cultivation methods
- Obstacles (conceptual thinking, preconceptions)
- Supporting conditions (openness, experience, reflection)
- Applications in various life domains

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Experiential understanding that transcends intellectual knowledge, arising when direct perception, lived experience, and deep reflection unite to produce transformative insight. This quality represents the integration of multiple ways of knowing into immediate, comprehensive understanding that changes both knower and known.

[Essential Nature]
Experiential understanding differs fundamentally from accumulated knowledge or intellectual comprehension. It emerges through the harmonious integration of direct perception, lived experience, and contemplative insight. This quality represents a way of knowing that transforms the knower, dissolving the usual separation between subject and object, leading to immediate comprehension that is simultaneously personal and universal.

This form of understanding operates at multiple levels simultaneously - sensory, emotional, intellectual, and intuitive - creating a unified field of knowing that transcends yet includes all these modes. It develops through cycles of experience, reflection, and integration, each cycle deepening and expanding understanding while transforming the consciousness through which understanding occurs.

[Manifestations]
- Moments of sudden, comprehensive insight where complex situations become immediately clear
- Deep recognition of patterns and principles operating across different domains of life
- Natural wisdom that emerges from integrated life experience rather than accumulated knowledge
- Ability to understand situations and people directly, beyond surface appearances
- Increasing alignment between understanding, being, and action
- Progressive dissolution of artificial boundaries between knower, knowing, and known
- Growing capacity to perceive and understand from multiple perspectives simultaneously

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through an iterative process where direct experience meets contemplative reflection, creating opportunities for insight that transcends both. Each moment of genuine understanding creates subtle changes in consciousness, allowing for even deeper understanding in future experiences. The process is self-catalyzing - each genuine insight increases capacity for further insight while simultaneously transforming the nature of understanding itself.

In practical terms, this manifests as growing wisdom that naturally influences all aspects of life. Decision-making becomes more intuitive yet more precise, relationship dynamics are understood with greater clarity, and complex situations are grasped in their entirety rather than piece by piece. This understanding naturally expresses itself in more skillful action, deeper empathy, and clearer perception across all life domains.

This universalized description aims to:
- Capture the transformative nature of ma'rifa without religious/cultural specifics
- Preserve the depth of the concept while making it accessible
- Connect individual experience to universal principles
- Maintain practical relevance and applicability
- Describe observable manifestations and development patterns

The description emphasizes the experiential and transformative aspects while avoiding culture-specific terminology or frameworks, making it accessible across traditions while preserving the essential depth of the original concept.
