Let me analyze and transform Tasamuh following the provided framework.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Active engagement with difference/diversity
Key functions:
- Facilitates peaceful coexistence
- Enables cultural exchange
- Builds social harmony
- Transforms potential conflict into growth
- Deepens understanding through difference

UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCES:
- Encountering difference/otherness
- Navigating disagreement
- Building bridges across divides
- Growing through challenge
- Finding common ground
- Learning from diversity

STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary function: Transforms difference from potential conflict to mutual enrichment
Developmental path: From basic acceptance → active engagement → mutual enrichment
Systemic role: Creates conditions for social harmony and cultural evolution

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to actively engage with difference in ways that transform potential conflict or separation into opportunities for mutual growth and enrichment. Beyond mere tolerance, it represents the skill of finding value in diversity while maintaining both truth and harmony in relationships across divides.

[Essential Nature]
This quality operates at the intersection of wisdom and relationship, where the challenge of difference meets the opportunity for growth. It manifests as a dynamic balance between maintaining one's own truth while genuinely engaging with different perspectives, beliefs, and ways of being. Unlike passive tolerance, it requires active engagement and the ability to hold complexity without reducing or oversimplifying differences.

This capacity emerges from a combination of inner security and genuine curiosity, allowing one to remain grounded in truth while opening to difference. It represents a sophisticated form of social wisdom that recognizes diversity as a source of collective enrichment rather than a problem to be solved.

[Manifestations]
- Maintaining respectful dialogue across significant differences
- Finding creative solutions that honor multiple perspectives
- Building bridges between different groups or viewpoints
- Transforming potential conflicts into opportunities for mutual understanding
- Facilitating cultural exchange and cross-pollination of ideas
- Creating environments where differences enrich rather than divide
- Developing deeper understanding through engagement with different perspectives

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a progression from basic acceptance of difference to active engagement with it, and finally to the ability to facilitate mutual enrichment through diversity. It requires building internal security strong enough to engage with difference without defensiveness, while cultivating genuine curiosity about other perspectives. The capacity grows through conscious practice in increasingly challenging situations, supported by reflection and deepening understanding of both self and other.

In practice, it manifests as the ability to create spaces and relationships where differences become sources of learning rather than conflict. This involves developing skills in dialogue, perspective-taking, and bridge-building, while maintaining authenticity and truth. The quality enables both individuals and communities to thrive in diversity, transforming potential sources of conflict into catalysts for growth and understanding.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the active/engaged nature of the original concept
2. Makes it accessible across cultural contexts
3. Maintains its sophistication while using universal language
4. Links individual development to collective harmony
5. Provides clear markers for development and practice
6. Connects abstract principles to concrete manifestations

The description should be meaningful across cultures while preserving the depth and sophistication of the original Andalusian concept. It connects personal development with social harmony and provides clear pathways for practical application.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the objectives?
