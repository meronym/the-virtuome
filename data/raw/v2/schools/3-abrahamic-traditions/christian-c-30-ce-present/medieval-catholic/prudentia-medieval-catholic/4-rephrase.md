Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS - PRUDENTIA
Core principle: Right reason applied to action; practical wisdom
Key functions: 
- Discernment of right action
- Integration of experience and principles
- Practical decision-making
- Foresight and planning
- Moral judgment

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING
Universal experiences:
- Need to make complex decisions
- Learning from experience
- Balancing competing factors
- Anticipating consequences
- Navigating uncertainty

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS
Primary:
- Practical wisdom capacity
- Experiential learning
- Judgment formation
- Action guidance

Secondary:
- Decision-making process
- Integration of knowledge
- Situational assessment
- Implementation skill

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to discern right action through the integration of understanding, experience, and foresight. It represents the mature ability to grasp the essential nature of situations, anticipate consequences, and determine appropriate responses that serve genuine human good.

[Essential Nature]
Practical wisdom emerges at the intersection of knowledge and experience, functioning as the bridge between understanding and action. It operates as an integrative capacity that combines clear perception of current reality, understanding of fundamental principles, recognition of patterns, and anticipation of consequences. This quality enables one to grasp what truly matters in complex situations and to determine actions that effectively serve worthwhile ends.

Unlike theoretical knowledge or mere cleverness, this capacity encompasses moral discernment and is oriented toward genuine human flourishing. It develops through reflected-upon experience and manifests as increasingly refined judgment.

[Manifestations]
- Clear discernment of essential factors in complex situations
- Balanced consideration of competing demands and principles
- Effective anticipation of likely consequences and implications
- Appropriate adaptation of general principles to specific circumstances
- Integration of past experience with present challenges
- Recognition of timing and manner crucial for effective action
- Development of nuanced judgment in recurring situations

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay of perception, reflection, and judgment. It begins with careful attention to reality, drawing on accumulated experience to recognize patterns and significant factors. This perceptual base combines with understanding of principles and causes, enabling one to trace likely consequences and identify appropriate responses. The process culminates in clear judgment about what specific action best serves the genuine good in that situation.

In practice, this manifests as the ability to navigate complex situations with good judgment, neither oversimplifying nor becoming paralyzed by complexity. It shows in the capacity to offer sound counsel, make timely decisions, and take effective action that accounts for both immediate circumstances and longer-term implications. This quality develops through intentional reflection on experience, learning from both successes and failures, and progressive refinement of judgment through faced challenges.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the sophisticated understanding of practical wisdom from the medieval tradition
2. Translates it into experiential rather than theoretical language
3. Makes it accessible without specialized knowledge
4. Maintains connection to practical application
5. Shows development path
6. Links individual to universal aspects

The description should be meaningful across cultures while preserving the depth of the original concept. It's practically applicable, shows clear development path, and describes observable manifestations. It connects individual capacity to universal human experience of needing to make wise decisions.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
