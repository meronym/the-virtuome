```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain sustained, meaningful engagement that combines emotional connection with disciplined practice, transforming routine activities into sources of deeper significance and development. It integrates focused attention, sincere commitment, and regular practice in service of personal growth and higher purpose.

[Essential Nature]
Devotion represents the human capacity to infuse sustained action with deeper meaning through the integration of emotional connection and disciplined practice. It operates at the intersection of feeling and doing, transforming routine into ritual through intentional engagement. This quality enables the development of expertise and insight through dedicated practice while maintaining emotional resonance and personal significance.

Unlike simple habit or emotional attachment alone, devotion combines the steadiness of discipline with the aliveness of genuine connection. It creates a self-reinforcing cycle where regular practice deepens meaning, and enhanced meaning motivates continued practice.

[Manifestations]
- Sustained engagement in meaningful practices despite fluctuating external conditions
- Regular renewal of commitment through conscious reconnection with purpose
- Integration of emotional satisfaction with disciplined execution
- Transformation of routine activities into opportunities for growth
- Development of increasing subtlety and depth in chosen pursuits
- Capacity to maintain enthusiasm while developing technical mastery
- Natural flow between formal practice and spontaneous expression

[Functional Description]
Devotion operates through a dual process of attention and integration. The attention aspect involves sustained focus on chosen pursuits, maintained through both disciplined practice and emotional engagement. The integration aspect combines technical skill development with deepening personal meaning, creating a comprehensive approach to growth and mastery. This quality develops through consistent practice supported by regular renewal of purpose and meaning.

In practical expression, devotion manifests as the ability to maintain long-term commitments while continuing to find fresh meaning and inspiration. It enables practitioners to weather difficulties through a combination of established discipline and genuine connection to purpose. This quality transforms potentially mechanical repetition into opportunities for discovery and development, sustaining both practical progress and personal significance over time.

This universalized description:
- Preserves the medieval concept's depth while making it accessible
- Maintains both practical and contemplative dimensions
- Links individual practice to universal human capacity
- Describes observable manifestations and development
- Offers clear contemporary applications
- Retains sophistication while using phenomenological language
