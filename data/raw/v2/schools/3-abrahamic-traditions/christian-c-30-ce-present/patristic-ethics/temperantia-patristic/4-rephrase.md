Let me follow the structured process to universalize Temperantia.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
- Core principle: Harmonious regulation of desires and impulses
- Key functions: Integration of physical/emotional drives with higher aims
- Systemic role: Foundation for sustainable development/growth
- Developmental aspects: Progressive refinement of self-regulation capacity

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
- Universal experiences: Managing desires, balancing needs, maintaining harmony
- Cross-cultural parallels: Various traditions' concepts of self-regulation
- Contemporary relevance: Addiction, consumption, digital discipline
- Timeless patterns: Development of internal harmony through conscious regulation

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to harmoniously regulate desires and impulses, creating a sustainable balance between immediate gratification and longer-term wellbeing. This faculty enables conscious integration of physical drives, emotional needs, and higher aspirations, fostering internal harmony and sustainable development.

[Essential Nature]
Self-regulation represents a fundamental organizing principle in human development, distinct from mere suppression or denial of desires. It operates as an active faculty of discernment that recognizes the appropriate role, timing, and expression of various human needs and impulses. Rather than opposing natural drives, it cultivates their healthy integration into a larger pattern of flourishing.

This capacity serves as both a protective and generative force - protecting from destructive excess while generating the conditions for sustainable growth. It creates the internal space necessary for higher development while maintaining healthy engagement with physical and emotional needs.

[Manifestations]
- Balanced relationship with physical appetites (food, rest, pleasure)
- Emotional equilibrium and proportionate responses
- Sustainable patterns of energy expenditure and renewal
- Harmonious integration of different life domains
- Clear discernment between immediate impulses and longer-term wellbeing
- Progressive refinement of choices and behaviors
- Development of internal standards and rhythms

[Functional Description]
This faculty operates through ongoing cycles of awareness, discernment, and conscious choice. It begins with clear recognition of impulses and desires, develops through understanding their appropriate role and timing, and matures into natural harmony between different aspects of being. Rather than forcing control, it cultivates an internal ecosystem where different needs find appropriate expression within a larger pattern of wellbeing.

In practical terms, this quality manifests as increasingly refined choices in daily life - from basic physical habits to complex emotional and social interactions. It enables sustainable engagement with life's pleasures while maintaining internal coherence and direction. This creates a foundation for both personal development and positive contribution to wider systems, as internal harmony naturally extends to external relationships and activities.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural accessibility: ✓ (uses universal human experiences)
2. Depth preservation: ✓ (maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear connection to daily choices and development)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (links personal regulation to wider harmony)
5. Developmental clarity: ✓ (shows progression from basic to refined regulation)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (concrete behavioral and experiential markers)

This universalized description maintains the sophisticated understanding of Temperantia while making it accessible and relevant across cultural contexts. It preserves the depth of the Patristic understanding while translating it into experiential terms that connect with contemporary challenges and universal human experiences.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the objectives?
