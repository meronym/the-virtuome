Let me follow the process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Caritas:
- Core principle: Transformative love that both receives and gives
- Key functions: Unifies, orders, elevates, transforms, connects
- Systemic role: Foundation and animating force of moral/spiritual life
- Developmental: Moves from received to given, particular to universal

2. UNIVERSALIZATION:
- Universal experiences: Deep connection, selfless care, transformative relationships
- Parallel concepts: Compassionate wisdom (Buddhism), Ren (Confucianism), Ubuntu (African)
- Contemporary relevance: Social bonds, ethical motivation, transformative relationships
- Timeless patterns: Reception-giving dynamic, particular-universal movement

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary:
- Nature: Participatory love that transforms both giver and receiver
- Manifestations: Care, service, understanding, presence
- Development: From self to others to universal
- Relationships: Foundational to human flourishing

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for transformative love that both receives and gives, enabling deep recognition of and response to value in others and the world. It manifests as the ability to be genuinely moved by others' well-being and to act consistently for their flourishing, while experiencing this movement as self-fulfilling rather than self-depleting.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the human capacity for participatory love that transforms both giver and receiver through genuine presence and response. It begins with receptivity - the ability to be deeply moved by value in others and reality - and naturally flows into generous giving. Unlike limited resources that deplete through giving, this quality grows and deepens through expression.

It operates as both foundation and culmination of human development, integrating emotional responsiveness with practical wisdom, personal growth with social contribution, and individual fulfillment with universal connection. The quality manifests uniquely in each person while reflecting universal patterns of human flourishing.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous recognition of and delight in others' authentic good
- Natural movement to protect and promote others' well-being
- Capacity to maintain caring presence amid others' suffering
- Integration of wisdom and warmth in practical support
- Experience of personal fulfillment through genuine service
- Development from particular attachments to universal concern
- Ability to receive and channel life-giving energy to others

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a dynamic interplay of receiving and giving. It begins with experiences of being genuinely valued and cared for, which awaken the capacity to recognize and respond to value in others. Through practice in particular relationships, it gradually expands in scope and depth, becoming more stable, wise, and universal in expression. The development involves both natural human maturation and intentional cultivation through reflection and practice.

In practical expression, it manifests as a distinctive way of seeing, feeling, and responding to others and reality. It enables recognition of genuine needs beneath surface behaviors, wisdom in timing and approach to support, and sustainable care that nourishes rather than depletes the giver. The quality creates an expanding cycle where giving and receiving become increasingly unified, fostering both personal growth and social transformation.

This universalization aims to:
- Preserve the transformative depth of the original concept
- Make it accessible across cultural frameworks
- Maintain practical applicability
- Connect individual experience to universal patterns
- Describe observable manifestations
- Include developmental aspects

The description addresses:
- Personal experience and development
- Interpersonal dynamics
- Universal patterns
- Practical expression
- Observable manifestations
- Growth/cultivation aspects

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect or elaborate on specific elements?
