Let me analyze and transform "Transformative Solidarity" following the outlined process.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Active engagement in mutual growth and shared struggle
Key functions: 
- Building authentic connections across differences
- Catalyzing collective transformation
- Supporting systemic change
- Fostering reciprocal growth

2. UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Shared struggle
- Mutual support
- Collective growth
- Community building
- Overcoming divisions

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary elements:
- Active participation in others' challenges
- Mutual transformation through relationship
- Systemic awareness and engagement
- Community building across differences

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to form authentic connections across social boundaries through shared struggle and mutual support, leading to personal and collective transformation. It combines deep relationship with systematic change, fostering growth for all participants while addressing underlying causes of separation and inequality.

[Essential Nature]
Transformative solidarity represents a dynamic integration of personal relationship and collective action, where authentic connection catalyzes mutual growth and systemic change. It operates through conscious participation in others' struggles while maintaining awareness of structural dimensions, creating spaces where genuine encounter leads to shared transformation. This quality transcends mere sympathy or support, requiring active engagement that reshapes both self and community through sustained, reciprocal relationship.

[Manifestations]
- Building authentic relationships across social boundaries
- Engaging in shared struggle while honoring different perspectives
- Supporting systematic change through collective action
- Fostering mutual growth through sustained engagement
- Creating spaces for genuine encounter and transformation
- Developing awareness of structural dimensions of challenges
- Maintaining long-term commitment to shared development

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive engagement with difference and inequality, beginning with recognition of shared humanity and growing through active participation in others' struggles. It requires balancing immediate relationship with broader awareness, while cultivating capacity for sustained engagement despite challenges. The process builds resilience through shared experience while developing deeper understanding of systemic dimensions.

In practice, transformative solidarity manifests as sustained commitment to specific communities or causes, where regular engagement leads to mutual growth and systematic change. It involves creating spaces for authentic encounter, supporting collective action, and maintaining awareness of both immediate needs and broader structural issues. Success requires balancing active support with receptivity to being changed through the relationship.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the core transformative aspect while making it accessible
2. Maintains both personal and systemic dimensions
3. Describes observable manifestations
4. Provides clear development pathway
5. Keeps practical applicability
6. Remains philosophically sophisticated while using accessible language

The description should be meaningful across cultures while maintaining the depth and practical value of the original concept. It connects individual experience to universal patterns and provides clear guidance for development and application.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect to better meet the specified criteria?
