Here's my attempt at the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Transformative solidarity is the active capacity to recognize and respond to our fundamental interconnection through sustained, practical commitment to collective liberation. It manifests as the integration of personal transformation with social action, expressed through concrete participation in struggles against oppression and for shared flourishing.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the mature development of human social consciousness, where awareness of interconnection evolves into active commitment to collective wellbeing. It transcends mere sympathy or charitable impulse, emerging as a sustained force that transforms both individual and community through practical engagement with liberation struggles.

The quality operates at the intersection of personal and collective transformation, integrating emotional resonance with strategic action, immediate response with long-term commitment, and individual growth with social change. It manifests as both an internal orientation and an external practice, continuously deepening through active engagement with concrete struggles.

[Manifestations]
- Sustained practical support for others' liberation struggles
- Active participation in collective resistance and transformation
- Creation and maintenance of cross-boundary alliances
- Integration of personal growth with social action
- Development of mutual aid networks and structures
- Concrete sharing of resources and risks
- Strategic commitment to long-term transformation

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive awakening to human interconnection, moving from initial recognition through growing awareness of structural conditions to active engagement in transformation. It operates by continuously strengthening the bridge between personal consciousness and collective action, creating sustainable patterns of mutual support and shared struggle. The development process involves both internal growth in awareness and external growth in capacity for effective action.

In practice, it manifests as committed participation in concrete struggles for justice, expressed through consistent material and strategic support for collective liberation movements. This participation generates reciprocal transformation, where individual growth and social change become inseparable aspects of a unified process. The quality creates durable networks of mutual support while maintaining focus on structural transformation, building capacity for sustained resistance and positive change.

This universalized description aims to:
- Preserve the radical nature of the original concept
- Make it accessible across contexts
- Maintain practical applicability
- Connect individual and collective dimensions
- Emphasize both internal and external aspects
- Keep focus on transformation and liberation
- Enable concrete implementation

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
