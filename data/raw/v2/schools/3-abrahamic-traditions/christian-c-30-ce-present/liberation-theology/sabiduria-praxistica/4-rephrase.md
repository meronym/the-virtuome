Let me analyze Sabiduría Praxística systematically before composition:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Integration of reflection and action leading to transformative understanding
Key functions:
- Bridges theory and practice
- Guides effective action
- Generates new knowledge through experience
- Enables strategic thinking
- Facilitates collective learning

Systemic role:
- Connects individual insight to collective action
- Links immediate tactics to long-term strategy
- Mediates between experience and understanding
- Integrates different forms of knowledge

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Learning through doing
- Growing from experience
- Developing practical wisdom
- Understanding through engagement
- Collective knowledge building

Contemporary applications:
- Organizational learning
- Social innovation
- Leadership development
- Community problem-solving
- Educational methodology

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS
Primary:
- Integration of thought and action
- Experiential learning cycle
- Collective knowledge development
- Strategic understanding
- Practical effectiveness

Secondary:
- Balance of reflection and action
- Community validation
- Continuous refinement
- Real-world testing

Based on this analysis, here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Integrative wisdom that emerges through the conscious union of thought and action, where understanding deepens through engaged practice and practice evolves through reflective understanding. This dynamic wisdom enables effective action while generating deeper insight through direct experience and collective reflection.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the sophisticated human capacity to learn and grow through the intentional integration of thinking and doing. It manifests as a dynamic spiral where action informs understanding and understanding guides action, continuously generating more refined and effective ways of engaging with reality. Unlike purely theoretical knowledge or mere practical skill, it embodies the harmonious fusion of deep comprehension with effective action.

This wisdom is inherently collective and transformative, developing through shared experience and mutual reflection while simultaneously changing both the knowers and their context. It combines the immediacy of direct experience with the depth of careful reflection, creating knowledge that is both practically powerful and theoretically rich.

[Manifestations]
- Ability to learn deeply from experience while maintaining theoretical perspective
- Capacity to adapt strategies based on practical feedback while holding broader vision
- Skill in facilitating collective learning through shared action and reflection
- Talent for identifying effective intervention points through combined analysis and experience
- Faculty for translating abstract understanding into concrete action
- Gift for generating theoretical insights from practical engagement
- Aptitude for building collective knowledge through collaborative action

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous cycle of engagement and reflection, where direct experience is consciously processed to generate deeper understanding, which then guides more effective action. It develops through intentional practice combining active engagement with reality, careful observation of results, collective reflection on experience, and strategic adaptation of approach. The process is inherently social, with individual insights being tested and refined through collective practice and dialogue.

In practical terms, this wisdom manifests as the ability to navigate complex situations effectively, combining strategic thinking with tactical flexibility. It enables individuals and groups to learn rapidly from experience, adapt approaches based on feedback, and develop increasingly sophisticated ways of engaging with challenges. This creates a progressive refinement of both understanding and action, leading to more effective and transformative engagement with reality.

This universal language version:
1. Preserves the essential integration of theory and practice
2. Maintains the collective and transformative aspects
3. Makes the concept accessible without specialized theological or political language
4. Retains the sophistication of the original concept
5. Emphasizes practical applicability
6. Connects individual development to collective processes
7. Highlights universal human capacity for integrative learning

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this description?
