      "content": "Let me analyze this systematically:\n\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS FOR SELECTION:\n\n1. THEOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS\nLiberation Theology fundamentally reinterprets Christian virtues through the lens of social liberation. The core virtues should reflect this distinctive synthesis of traditional Christian ethics with revolutionary praxis.\n\n2. DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS\nThe selected virtues should capture what makes Liberation Theology unique among Christian traditions - its emphasis on structural change, social justice, and the perspective of the oppressed.\n\n3. PRACTICAL IMPACT\nGiven Liberation Theology's emphasis on praxis, the core virtues should have clear manifestations in concrete social action and community organization.\n\n4. HISTORICAL CONTEXT\nThe virtues should reflect both the Latin American origin of the movement and its broader application to situations of oppression worldwide.\n\n5. INTERCONNECTION\nThe selected virtues should form a coherent system, showing how Liberation Theology's understanding of personal virtue is inherently connected to social transformation.\n\nREASONING FOR SELECTION:\n\n1. I believe the core list should include both:\n- Traditional Christian virtues reinterpreted through liberation lens\n- Novel virtues emerging from liberation praxis\n\n2. The selection should reflect the movement's key dialectics:\n- Personal/Social\n- Spiritual/Political\n- Theoretical/Practical\n- Traditional/Revolutionary\n\n3. The virtues should represent different aspects of liberation:\n- Consciousness-raising\n- Social action\n- Community building\n- Prophetic witness\n- Structural transformation\n\nPROPOSED SHORTLIST:\n\n1. Liberative Solidarity (Solidaridad Liberadora)\n- Foundational virtue combining traditional Christian love with revolutionary praxis\n- Encompasses both personal commitment and structural change\n- Links individual virtue to collective liberation\n\n2. Prophetic Courage (Valent\u00eda Prof\u00e9tica)\n- Speaking truth to power\n- Willingness to face consequences\n- Combines spiritual witness with political action\n\n3. Critical Consciousness (Concientizaci\u00f3n)\n- Awareness of social conditions\n- Capacity for structural analysis\n- Integration of reflection and action\n\n4. Preferential Love for the Poor (Amor Preferencial)\n- Fundamental orientation toward the marginalized\n- Active commitment to justice\n- Reinterpretation of traditional Christian charity\n\n5. Communal Agency (Agencia Comunitaria)\n- Collective empowerment\n- Shared responsibility\n- Democratic participation\n\n6. Historical Hope (Esperanza Hist\u00f3rica)\n- Faith in possibility of change\n- Vision of alternative future\n- Grounded optimism\n\n7. Praxical Wisdom (Sabidur\u00eda Prax\u00edstica)\n- Integration of theory and practice\n- Learned through struggle\n- Collective knowledge-building\n\n8. Transformative Faithfulness (Fidelidad Transformadora)\n- Creative loyalty to tradition\n- Innovative interpretation\n- Constructive critique\n\n9. Martyrial Witness (Testimonio Martirial)\n- Ultimate commitment\n- Sacrificial service\n- Living testimony\n\nThese nine virtues form an interconnected system that captures the essence of Liberation Theology's approach to human development and social transformation. Each virtue:\n- Has clear theological foundations\n- Manifests in concrete practices\n- Contributes to personal and social liberation\n- Links individual development with collective transformation\n\nWould you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML+Markdown nodes for these core virtues?"
