Let me follow the analytical process step by step:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Collective capacity for self-directed action and transformation
Key functions: 
- Empowerment through unity
- Shared decision-making
- Distributed leadership
- Collective wisdom activation
Systemic role: Creates sustainable, democratic social transformation

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS:
Universal experiences:
- Group decision-making
- Collective problem-solving
- Community self-organization
- Shared responsibility
- Mutual empowerment

Parallel concepts:
- Indigenous council systems
- Democratic cooperatives
- Collective leadership
- Social movement organizing
- Community resilience

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Primary Elements:
- Core: Collective self-actualization
- Function: Transforms passive recipients into active agents
- Development: Grows through practice and shared experience
- Relations: Builds networked power and mutual support

Based on this analysis, here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity of groups to act as unified, self-directing entities through shared leadership, collective decision-making, and coordinated action. This quality transforms collections of individuals into coherent communities capable of shaping their circumstances and future through democratic participation and distributed responsibility.

[Essential Nature]
Collective Agency represents the emergence of group consciousness and capability beyond the sum of individual contributions. It manifests when people recognize their shared power and develop structures for exercising it effectively together. This quality enables communities to move from passive recipients of circumstances to active shapers of their reality, through processes that honor both individual voices and collective wisdom.

The essence of this quality lies in the transformation of "power over" into "power with," creating systems where leadership circulates, decisions emerge from genuine dialogue, and action flows from shared understanding and commitment. It requires constant cultivation of trust, communication skills, and mutual accountability.

[Manifestations]
- Effective collective decision-making processes that balance inclusion with efficiency
- Emergence of situational leadership based on capability rather than position
- Development of shared understanding through structured dialogue and reflection
- Creation of systems for distributed responsibility and mutual accountability
- Regular practices of collective learning and adaptation
- Capacity to mobilize resources and coordinate action at scale
- Cultivation of new leaders through mentorship and shared responsibility

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through iterative cycles of dialogue, decision, action, and reflection. It requires structured processes for sharing perspectives, building consensus, and coordinating action, while maintaining flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances. The quality grows stronger through successful collective experiences, developing both individual capabilities and group processes simultaneously.

In practice, it transforms how communities address challenges and pursue opportunities. Rather than waiting for external solutions or following traditional hierarchies, groups with strong collective agency create their own responses through participatory processes. This leads to more sustainable solutions, stronger community bonds, and increased capacity for future action. Success builds confidence, which enables taking on larger challenges, creating a positive feedback loop of growing capability.

This universalized description:
1. Maintains the core transformative element of the original concept
2. Makes it accessible to different cultural contexts
3. Preserves the sophisticated understanding of group dynamics
4. Provides clear practical applications
5. Shows development pathways
6. Links individual and collective dimensions

The description answers the verification questions:
1. Cross-cultural meaning ✓ (focuses on universal group dynamics)
2. Original depth preserved ✓ (maintains transformative emphasis)
3. Practical applicability ✓ (clear manifestations and processes)
4. Individual-universal connection ✓ (shows relationship between personal and collective)
5. Development clarity ✓ (describes growth process)
6. Observable manifestations ✓ (concrete indicators provided)

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
