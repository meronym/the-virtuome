Let me follow the analytical process step by step:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Active orientation toward uplifting marginalized people
Key functions:
- Reframes love through justice lens
- Guides resource allocation/priorities
- Structures ethical decision-making
- Shapes institutional priorities
Systemic role: Foundational organizing principle for social engagement

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Recognition of inequality
- Empathic response to suffering
- Moral imperative for justice
- Tension between equality and priority
Contemporary applications:
- Social policy
- Resource allocation
- Institutional design
- Personal lifestyle choices

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Ethical prioritization
- Active engagement
- Structural transformation
- Material and spiritual integration

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The conscious orientation of attention, resources, and action toward those experiencing marginalization or systemic disadvantage, combined with the recognition that addressing their needs holds priority in ethical decision-making and social organization. This orientation integrates personal commitment with structural transformation.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents a fundamental ethical stance that recognizes asymmetry in human relationships and social structures, demanding differential response based on need and vulnerability. It combines clear-eyed recognition of inequality with active commitment to transformation, operating simultaneously at personal and systemic levels. Unlike simple charity or general benevolence, it encompasses a structural analysis of disadvantage while maintaining the immediacy of personal response to suffering. The quality manifests as both an organizing principle for social action and an internal orientation of consciousness.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent prioritization of marginalized perspectives in decision-making
- Active reallocation of resources toward areas of greatest need
- Development of institutions and systems that center disadvantaged voices
- Personal lifestyle choices that reflect solidarity with struggling communities
- Creation of spaces where marginalized groups exercise genuine agency
- Transformation of social relationships to eliminate patterns of domination
- Integration of immediate aid with long-term structural change

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous dialectic between awareness and action, where growing recognition of systemic inequalities informs increasingly sophisticated responses. It begins with emotional resonance with suffering but develops into structural understanding and strategic action. The quality matures through stages: from simple helping impulses, through recognition of systemic causes, to sophisticated integration of immediate response with long-term transformation.

In practical expression, this quality transforms both personal and institutional decision-making processes. It manifests in systematic prioritization of marginalized voices, strategic resource allocation, and development of new organizational forms that center disadvantaged perspectives. Rather than occasional charitable acts, it produces consistent patterns of preferential action and structural reorganization aimed at eliminating the conditions that create marginalization.

This universalized version maintains the core insights of Liberation Theology's "preferential option" while making them accessible across cultural and religious contexts. It preserves:
- The emphasis on structural transformation
- The integration of personal and social dimensions
- The priority of marginalized perspectives
- The active/transformative nature of the response

While removing:
- Specific religious language
- Latin American cultural context
- Catholic theological framework
- Marxist analytical terminology

The description remains:
- Practically applicable
- Developmentally clear
- Systemically sophisticated
- Universally relevant

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
