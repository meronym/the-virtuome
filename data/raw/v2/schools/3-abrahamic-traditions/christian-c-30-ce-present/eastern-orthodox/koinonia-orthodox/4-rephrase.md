Let me follow the process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Integrative communion/participatory unity
Functions: 
- Creates cohesive social bonds
- Facilitates shared experience
- Enables collective transformation
- Maintains group coherence
- Deepens individual through collective
Systemic role: Foundation for authentic community

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Sense of belonging
- Shared purpose
- Collective identity
- Deep connection
- Mutual support
Contemporary applications:
- Community building
- Group dynamics
- Social cohesion
- Collective practices

3. STRUCTURED UNIVERSAL DESCRIPTION:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity and practice of deep participatory connection that transforms individual experience through authentic collective engagement, creating a shared field of meaning, purpose, and mutual support that transcends yet enriches individual identity while fostering collective wisdom and growth.

[Essential Nature]
Koinonia represents a fundamental human capacity for meaningful collective experience that goes beyond mere social interaction or group membership. It describes the emergence of a genuine shared field of experience where individuals participate in something larger than themselves without losing their unique identity. This quality manifests as both a state of being and an active practice, combining receptivity to collective wisdom with conscious contribution to group wellbeing.

This integrative communion operates at multiple levels simultaneously: physical presence and shared activity, emotional resonance and mutual support, shared meaning-making and purpose, and participation in collective insight and understanding. It represents the human capacity to transcend individual limitations through authentic community while enhancing rather than diminishing individual development.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous emergence of group coherence and shared understanding
- Seamless coordination and cooperation without forced structure
- Deep sense of belonging while maintaining individual authenticity
- Mutual enhancement of individual and collective growth
- Natural emergence of collective wisdom and shared insight
- Organic distribution of resources and support based on need
- Integration of diversity into higher-order unity

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay between individual and collective dimensions of human experience. It requires both active participation and receptive openness, creating a field of shared meaning and purpose that enhances individual development while fostering collective wisdom. The process involves progressive deepening of trust, understanding, and mutual support, leading to increasingly sophisticated forms of collective functioning.

In practice, it manifests as the capacity to move fluidly between individual and collective modes of being, contributing uniquely while remaining open to collective wisdom. This creates self-organizing systems of mutual support and shared understanding, where individual growth and collective development become mutually enhancing rather than competing forces. The result is authentic community that preserves and enhances individual uniqueness while enabling access to collective resources and wisdom.
