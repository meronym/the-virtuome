Let me first analyze Prosoche following the preparation framework:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Focused awareness and sustained attention
Key functions:
- Mental clarity and presence
- Integration of awareness
- Protection of consciousness
- Quality of perception
- Sustained engagement

Systemic role:
- Foundation for other virtues
- Gateway to deeper practice
- Stabilizing function
- Quality enhancer

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Mental clarity vs. distraction
- Present-moment awareness
- Quality of attention
- Conscious vs. automatic living

Parallel concepts:
- Mindfulness (Buddhist)
- Presence (contemporary)
- Witnessing awareness (Hindu)
- Focused consciousness (psychological)

Based on this analysis, here's the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain clear, sustained awareness of present experience, combining alert attention with receptive presence. This quality enables conscious engagement with both inner states and outer circumstances, creating the conditions for intentional living and deeper understanding.

[Essential Nature]
Attentiveness represents the fundamental human capacity to be fully present to experience rather than operating on automatic pilot. It involves both active and receptive aspects: the ability to direct and sustain attention while remaining open and responsive to what emerges in awareness. This quality serves as a foundation for all conscious development, combining clarity with engagement, awareness with presence.

The nature of attentiveness is inherently integrative, bringing together the observing and participating aspects of consciousness. It enables both sharp discernment and deep receptivity, allowing for both precise focus and broader awareness. This dual capacity makes it essential for both practical functioning and deeper development.

[Manifestations]
- Sustained focus without tension or rigidity
- Clear recognition of mental and emotional states as they arise
- Enhanced quality of perception and engagement
- Natural presence in daily activities
- Reduced automatic/reactive behavior
- Integration of observation and participation
- Increased depth and quality of experience

[Functional Description]
Attentiveness operates through the cultivation of stable, clear awareness that can be sustained without strain. It develops through deliberate practice in focusing attention while maintaining an open, receptive quality. This involves strengthening both the capacity to stay present and the ability to notice when attention has wandered, gradually building a more stable foundation of conscious awareness.

In practical terms, this quality transforms daily experience by bringing greater clarity, depth, and intentionality to all activities. It enables more conscious choices, deeper engagement with experience, and enhanced quality of perception. This leads to reduced reactivity, greater emotional intelligence, and more authentic participation in life. The result is a more awake, engaged, and conscious way of living.

This universalized description maintains the essential aspects of Prosoche while making it accessible across cultural contexts. It preserves the depth of the original Orthodox concept while expressing it in experiential rather than theological terms. The focus on observable manifestations and practical development makes it applicable regardless of philosophical or religious background.

The description connects individual experience (personal attention) with universal aspects (consciousness and awareness), while maintaining clear developmental trajectories and practical applications. It addresses both the "how" (functional description) and the "what" (manifestations) of the quality.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this universalization process or refine any part of the description further?
