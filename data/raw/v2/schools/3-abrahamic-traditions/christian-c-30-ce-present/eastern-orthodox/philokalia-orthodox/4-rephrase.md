Let me follow the process systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Integration of beauty, truth, and goodness as transformative force
Functions: Perception cultivation, aesthetic-spiritual integration, transformative vision
Systemic role: Bridges material and spiritual, connects perception with transformation
Developmental: Moves from external to internal to universal beauty perception

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Recognition of profound beauty
- Transformative aesthetic experiences
- Harmony perception
- Integration of form and essence

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary pattern: Beauty recognition → interior cultivation → transformative vision
Developmental arc: Appreciation → discernment → embodiment → radiation

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, cultivate, and embody profound beauty, operating as an integrative force that transforms perception, understanding, and being. This quality enables the recognition of essential beauty in all dimensions of existence while fostering its expression through one's way of being and acting in the world.

[Essential Nature]
Beauty-love represents a fundamental human capacity that integrates aesthetic sensitivity with deeper recognition of essential qualities in reality. Unlike surface-level aesthetic appreciation, it functions as a transformative force that develops through stages: from recognition of outer beauty, through discernment of inner beauty, to embodiment of essential beauty in one's being.

This quality serves as a bridge between form and essence, connecting immediate perception with deeper understanding. It operates simultaneously as a mode of perception, a path of development, and a way of being that progressively refines both the perceiver and their expression in the world.

[Manifestations]
- Refined perception that recognizes beauty in both obvious and unexpected places
- Natural cultivation of harmony and proportion in thought, speech, and action
- Integration of outer form with inner essence in creative expression
- Spontaneous recognition of profound meaning in everyday experiences
- Progressive refinement of taste that transcends cultural conditioning
- Capacity to perceive and foster the highest potential in people and situations
- Natural radiation of grace that elevates the quality of environments and interactions

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of perception and expression, operating through a dual movement of recognition and embodiment. As perception becomes more refined, it naturally influences action, leading to increasingly harmonious expression. This creates a positive feedback loop where enhanced perception leads to more beautiful expression, which in turn develops greater perceptive capacity.

In practical terms, this manifests as an increasing ability to recognize and foster beauty in all dimensions of life - from physical environments to human relationships to inner states. It naturally elevates the quality of all activities, leading to more harmonious and meaningful ways of living and interacting. This quality serves as both a compass for development and a natural expression of inner maturity.
