Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Clear-minded discernment and self-regulation
Functions: Decision-making, emotional regulation, rational assessment
Systemic role: Enables wisdom, protects from excess, maintains balance
Developmental: Progresses from external restraint to internal clarity

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Need for clear judgment
- Challenge of emotional balance
- Importance of measured response
- Value of mental clarity

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary elements:
- Mental clarity and presence
- Emotional equilibrium
- Rational discernment
- Measured response

Here's the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for clear-minded presence and balanced engagement with life, characterized by emotional equilibrium, rational discernment, and measured response to circumstances. This quality enables one to maintain perspective, make sound judgments, and engage with reality in an undistorted way.

[Essential Nature]
Clear-minded presence represents a fundamental human capacity for experiencing and responding to life without distortion or excess. It manifests as a state of internal balance where emotion and reason work in harmony, allowing for accurate perception and appropriate response. This quality acts as both a stabilizing force and a clarity-enhancing lens, enabling individuals to navigate complexity while maintaining perspective and equilibrium.

This state of balanced awareness serves as a foundation for wisdom, protecting against the natural human tendencies toward excess, reactivity, and clouded judgment. It operates through the cultivation of internal stillness, emotional regulation, and disciplined attention.

[Manifestations]
- Maintenance of emotional equilibrium in challenging situations
- Capacity for careful consideration before action
- Clear discernment in decision-making processes
- Balanced engagement with pleasures and responsibilities
- Steady presence in times of crisis or excitement
- Recognition of appropriate boundaries and limits
- Integration of reason and feeling in responses

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the interplay of self-awareness, practiced restraint, and cultivated wisdom. It begins with recognition of how mental and emotional states influence perception and behavior, progresses through conscious regulation of responses, and matures into natural equilibrium. The development process involves both letting go of excessive reactions and building capacity for clear presence.

In practical application, this quality enables individuals to maintain perspective in challenging situations, make decisions without being overwhelmed by emotion or impulse, and engage with life's pleasures and challenges in a balanced way. It supports both personal wellbeing and effective functioning in relationships and responsibilities, while fostering the development of wisdom through clear perception and measured response.
