Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Wholeness/coherence between inner truth and outer expression
Key functions:
- Alignment of values and actions
- Maintenance of consistent ethical standards
- Integration of different life aspects
- Self-congruence across contexts
Systemic role: Creates trust, reliability, and social coherence

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Inner sense of truth/authenticity
- Consistency/inconsistency awareness
- Trust-building/breaking moments
- Personal congruence/dissonance
Contemporary applications:
- Professional ethics
- Personal relationships
- Leadership
- Digital identity

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary: Wholeness, consistency, authenticity
Secondary: Truth-telling, promise-keeping, ethical decision-making

Now, the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of maintaining consistent wholeness between one's inner truth and outer expression, manifesting as reliability of character across all contexts and circumstances. It represents the active alignment of values, words, and actions into a coherent and trustworthy way of being.

[Essential Nature]
Integrity functions as an integrating force in human character, creating coherence between internal values and external behavior. It operates through continuous conscious alignment of thoughts, words, and actions, maintaining consistency even when facing pressure or temptation to compromise. This quality enables authentic self-expression while fostering trust and reliability in social relationships.

Beyond mere honesty or moral correctness, integrity represents a state of being whole and undivided - where one's various life aspects form a unified, consistent pattern. It serves as both an internal compass for decision-making and an external framework for trustworthy interaction with others.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent alignment between stated values and observable actions
- Maintenance of ethical standards regardless of external pressures
- Transparent and truthful communication in all contexts
- Reliable fulfillment of commitments and promises
- Integration of professional, personal, and social roles
- Congruent behavior across different situations and relationships
- Active resolution of internal conflicts and contradictions

[Functional Description]
Integrity operates through continuous self-monitoring and active alignment of internal states with external expressions. It requires ongoing awareness of one's values, regular ethical reflection, and conscious choice-making in alignment with one's principles. This quality develops through repeated choices to maintain consistency, especially when facing challenges or temptations to compromise.

In practical expression, integrity manifests as reliability in relationships, trustworthiness in commitments, and consistency in ethical behavior. It creates a foundation of trust in social interactions, enables authentic leadership, and fosters deep connections through genuine self-expression. The impact extends beyond individual reputation to contribute to social coherence and collective trust-building.
