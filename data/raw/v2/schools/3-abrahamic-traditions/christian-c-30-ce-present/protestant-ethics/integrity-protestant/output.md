[Core Definition]
The quality of maintaining consistent wholeness between one's inner truth and outer expression, manifesting as reliability of character across all contexts and circumstances. It represents the active alignment of values, words, and actions into a coherent and trustworthy way of being.

In practical expression, integrity manifests as reliability in relationships, trustworthiness in commitments, and consistency in ethical behavior.
