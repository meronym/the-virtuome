Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF IḤSĀN:
- Core principle: Excellence through mindful presence and conscious beautification
- Key functions: Elevates action, deepens awareness, beautifies conduct
- Systemic role: Qualitative transformer of all other virtues/actions
- Developmental aspect: Progressive refinement of awareness and execution

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences it relates to:
- The qualitative difference between mechanical and mindful action
- The experience of full presence vs. autopilot
- The satisfaction of doing something "just right"
- The transformative power of sustained attention
- The beauty that emerges from careful attention to detail

STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Primary:
- Nature: Conscious excellence through presence
- Manifestation: Beautiful execution in any domain
- Development: From external form to internal state to unified presence
- Relations: Amplifies and refines other qualities

Secondary:
- Obstacles: Automaticity, distraction, rushing, superficiality
- Conditions: Mindfulness, patience, skill development
- Related: Mastery, presence, consciousness, beauty
- Applications: Any deliberate human action or creation

Here's the universal description following the requested format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The transformative quality of conscious excellence that emerges when complete presence meets skillful action, manifesting as beauty in conduct, creation, and character. It represents the synthesis of deep awareness with masterful execution, elevating any activity from mechanical performance to artistic expression.

[Essential Nature]
Ihsan represents the highest form of human action and being - the point where inner consciousness and outer expression become one. It's the qualitative dimension that transforms ordinary actions into expressions of beauty and ordinary awareness into enlightened presence. Unlike simple competence or effectiveness, it captures the aesthetic and spiritual dimensions of excellence that emerge when complete attention meets devoted skill.

This quality operates at the intersection of consciousness and action, where the doer, the doing, and the deed become unified. It manifests whenever mechanical activity is transformed through the alchemy of presence into something that reflects both mastery and beauty. While rooted in spiritual consciousness, it expresses itself in the most practical and observable ways.

[Manifestations]
- Extraordinary care and attention to detail in any task, however mundane
- Graceful efficiency where no motion is wasted yet nothing feels rushed
- Natural beauty in execution that seems effortless yet reflects deep mastery
- Heightened awareness that transforms routine actions into conscious art
- The subtle difference between work that is merely complete and work that sings
- The palpable quality that emerges when someone performs their craft with total presence
- The harmonious flow state where doer and action become one

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a progressive refinement of both consciousness and skill. It begins with mechanical competence, evolves through mindful practice, and culminates in a state where awareness and action are unified. The developmental path involves increasingly subtle attention to quality, continuous refinement of execution, and deepening of presence until excellence becomes natural rather than forced.

In practical expression, it manifests as that observable difference between work done with mere technical competence and work that carries the signature of conscious beauty. It's visible in the chef who cooks with love, the craftsperson who works with reverence, the teacher who teaches with presence, or the caregiver who serves with full attention. This quality transforms not only the action but also the actor and those who experience the results of such conscious excellence.

This universalization aims to:
- Capture the spiritual depth of ihsan without religious-specific language
- Maintain its practical applicability across contexts
- Preserve its transformative power
- Make it accessible through common human experiences
- Retain its sophistication while using phenomenological language

Would you like me to:
1. Refine any particular aspect?
2. Expand on the developmental trajectory?
3. Add more practical examples?
4. Elaborate on specific manifestations?
