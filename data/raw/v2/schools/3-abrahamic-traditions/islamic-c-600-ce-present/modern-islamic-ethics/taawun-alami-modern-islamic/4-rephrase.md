Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Taʿāwun ʿĀlamī:

Core principle: Collaborative human potential actualized across boundaries
Key functions:
- Bridges divides between groups
- Enables collective problem-solving
- Creates shared value/progress
- Builds sustainable relationships
- Transforms differences into strengths

Systemic roles:
- Catalyst for human development
- Framework for managing diversity
- Platform for knowledge exchange
- Structure for collective action
- Medium for cultural evolution

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:

Universal experiences:
- Recognition of shared challenges
- Discovery of complementary capabilities
- Joy of successful collaboration
- Growth through difference
- Collective achievement

Contemporary applications:
- Global challenges (climate, health, poverty)
- Cross-cultural innovation
- Knowledge ecosystems
- Collaborative technologies
- Shared resource management

Here's my attempt at the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The human capacity to transform differences into creative potential through principled collaboration across boundaries, enabling collective progress through the synergy of diverse perspectives, capabilities, and resources. This quality manifests as both an individual virtue and a collective practice that generates shared value while preserving and celebrating diversity.

[Essential Nature]
Collaborative potential represents a fundamental human capability to create value through difference rather than despite it. It operates by recognizing complementary strengths, establishing shared understanding, and building trust across conventional boundaries. This quality transforms potential conflicts into opportunities for mutual growth, enabling solutions that no single perspective could achieve alone.

Unlike simple cooperation, it involves deep engagement with difference as a source of innovation and growth. It requires holding multiple perspectives simultaneously while maintaining both individual integrity and collective harmony. The quality develops through progressive stages of engagement, from basic recognition of shared interests to profound co-creation of new possibilities.

[Manifestations]
- Ability to build trust and understanding across cultural, professional, or ideological boundaries
- Skill in identifying and activating complementary capabilities in diverse groups
- Capacity to maintain both individual authenticity and genuine openness to difference
- Practice of transforming potential conflicts into opportunities for mutual growth
- Development of shared frameworks that preserve and benefit from diversity
- Creation of sustainable collaborative structures that generate ongoing value
- Facilitation of knowledge and resource exchange that enriches all participants

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay of individual and collective development. At the individual level, it involves growing capacity to engage productively with difference while maintaining personal integrity. At the collective level, it creates self-reinforcing cycles of trust-building, shared learning, and value creation. The process requires continuous balance between unity and diversity, structure and flexibility, individual and collective interests.

In practice, this quality enables sustainable solutions to complex challenges by orchestrating diverse capabilities toward shared goals. It manifests in cross-cultural innovations, collaborative knowledge creation, and collective problem-solving initiatives. Success builds confidence in collaborative approaches, creating positive feedback loops that strengthen both individual capacity and collective capability for addressing increasingly complex challenges.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the Islamic emphasis on principled collaboration while making it accessible to all
2. Maintains the depth of seeing difference as strength rather than obstacle
3. Connects individual virtue to collective practice
4. Provides clear developmental pathway
5. Identifies observable manifestations
6. Highlights contemporary relevance
7. Maintains sophistication while using accessible language

Would you like me to:
1. Refine any particular aspect?
2. Add more specific examples?
3. Elaborate on the developmental process?
4. Strengthen any particular dimension?
