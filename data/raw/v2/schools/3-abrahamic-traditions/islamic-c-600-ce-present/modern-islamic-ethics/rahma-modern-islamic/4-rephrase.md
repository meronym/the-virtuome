Let me follow the systematic process to universalize Raḥmah while preserving its essential depth.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Active, expansive compassion that transforms both giver and receiver
Key functions: 
- Motivates care and support
- Builds inclusive consciousness
- Transforms suffering into connection
- Enables sustainable helping behavior
- Creates ripple effects of positive change

Universal experiences:
- Recognition of shared vulnerability
- Impulse to alleviate suffering
- Experience of caring connection
- Transformation through helping others
- Expansion of circle of concern

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The innate human capacity for expansive compassion that recognizes shared vulnerability and responds with sustained care and practical support. This quality transforms both giver and receiver, gradually expanding one's circle of concern while maintaining the depth and authenticity of compassionate response.

[Essential Nature]
Active compassion manifests as an intelligent sensitivity to suffering combined with the wisdom and energy to respond effectively. Unlike simple emotional empathy, it integrates clear recognition, genuine concern, and skilled action. This quality develops through progressive expansion - from personal to universal care - while maintaining immediacy and authenticity in each specific instance.

The distinguishing characteristic is its self-sustaining nature: rather than depleting through giving, it grows stronger and wider through exercise. This creates an upward spiral where compassionate action increases capacity for compassion, gradually extending one's scope of concern while deepening the quality of response.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous recognition of and response to suffering across traditional boundaries
- Sustained energy for helping others without emotional burnout
- Natural inclusion of previously overlooked beings in sphere of concern
- Practical wisdom in addressing both immediate needs and root causes
- Integration of personal care with broader humanitarian action
- Development of supporting systems and structures for compassionate action
- Progressive expansion of scope while maintaining depth of response

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interaction between recognition, response, and transformation. Initial recognition of suffering triggers an immediate impulse to help, which when acted upon creates connection. This connection transforms both helper and helped, expanding perspective and capacity. The experience builds confidence and skill in compassionate action, making future recognition and response more natural and effective.

In practical terms, this manifests as reliable helping behavior that intelligently addresses both acute and systemic needs. Rather than leading to compassion fatigue, regular exercise of this quality develops greater resilience and scope. It naturally moves from individual acts of kindness to participation in broader humanitarian initiatives while maintaining the intimate quality of personal care in each instance.
