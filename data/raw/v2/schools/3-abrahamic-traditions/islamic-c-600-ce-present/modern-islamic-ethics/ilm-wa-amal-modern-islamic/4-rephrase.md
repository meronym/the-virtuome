Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of ʿIlm wa-ʿAmal:

Core principle: Integration of knowledge and action/practice
Key functions:
- Unifies understanding and implementation
- Validates knowledge through application
- Refines theory through practice
- Enables practical wisdom development
- Ensures knowledge becomes transformative

Systemic roles:
- Bridges theoretical-practical gap
- Creates feedback loops between learning and doing
- Enables knowledge verification/refinement
- Supports continuous improvement
- Facilitates wisdom development

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:

Universal experiences:
- Learning through doing
- Theory-practice integration
- Experiential knowledge building
- Practical wisdom development
- Mastery through application

Contemporary relevance:
- Professional development
- Skill acquisition
- Evidence-based practice
- Action research
- Experiential learning

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The dynamic integration of understanding and action, where knowledge deeply informs practice while experience enriches understanding. This quality manifests as the capacity to seamlessly unite learning with doing, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of growth where theoretical insight and practical application continuously enhance each other.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the harmonious fusion of intellectual comprehension and practical implementation, transcending the common divide between theory and practice. It operates through a dynamic interplay where abstract understanding guides action, while practical experience deepens and refines theoretical knowledge. This integration creates a form of living wisdom that is both deeply understood and skillfully expressed.

The quality develops through deliberate practice of connecting insight with action, requiring both the humility to test understanding through application and the discernment to extract deeper principles from experience. It manifests as an increasingly refined ability to navigate complex situations with both theoretical depth and practical effectiveness.

[Manifestations]
- Theoretical understanding naturally flowing into effective action
- Practical experience systematically deepening conceptual understanding
- Skillful adaptation of principles to varied contexts and situations
- Growing capacity to learn from experience while applying knowledge
- Increasing ability to identify and extract principles from practice
- Development of nuanced judgment informed by both theory and experience
- Natural integration of learning and doing in approaching new challenges

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through continuous cycles of understanding, application, reflection, and refinement. When encountering new situations, it enables simultaneous access to theoretical frameworks and practical wisdom, allowing for informed action that is both principled and effective. The ongoing interplay between knowledge and action creates an upward spiral of development, where each informs and enhances the other.

In practical expression, this quality manifests as the ability to move fluidly between understanding and action, theory and practice. It enables effective problem-solving through the application of knowledge while simultaneously learning from experience. This creates a distinctive form of competence characterized by both deep understanding and practical effectiveness, leading to increasingly refined judgment and capability across diverse situations.
