STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Now presenting universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for sustained, rigorous intellectual effort in understanding complex situations and deriving sound solutions. It combines methodical analysis with creative insight, enabling the thoughtful application of established principles to new challenges while maintaining integrity with foundational truths.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the human capacity for disciplined intellectual engagement with challenging questions and evolving circumstances. It manifests as a dynamic integration of analytical rigor and creative insight, characterized by careful examination of evidence, systematic reasoning, and principled innovation. Beyond mere problem-solving, it embodies the mind's ability to bridge established wisdom with emerging challenges, maintaining continuity while enabling growth and adaptation.

The quality develops through consistent practice in facing and resolving complex challenges, supported by deep knowledge of relevant principles and methods. It requires both intellectual humility and confident engagement, combining respect for established understanding with the courage to explore new territory.

[Manifestations]
- Systematic analysis of complex problems from multiple angles
- Creative application of principles to novel situations
- Balanced integration of traditional wisdom with contemporary needs
- Careful weighing of evidence and methodical reasoning
- Persistent intellectual effort in face of difficulty
- Principled innovation that maintains coherence with foundations
- Active engagement with emerging challenges while respecting established knowledge

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay of analytical and creative faculties. It begins with thorough understanding of relevant principles and precedents, then engages in careful analysis of current challenges or questions. Through sustained intellectual effort, it systematically explores possible approaches while maintaining rigorous standards of evidence and reasoning. The process involves both linear analysis and intuitive insight, combining methodical examination with creative breakthrough moments.

In practical application, this quality enables individuals and communities to face new challenges while maintaining connection to foundational principles. It manifests in the ability to develop fresh solutions that are both innovative and well-grounded, to navigate complex decision-making with both creativity and rigor, and to advance understanding while preserving essential truths. This balance of conservation and innovation allows for authentic growth and adaptation while maintaining integrity with core principles.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: ✓ (focuses on universal human capacity for reasoning and problem-solving)
2. Depth preservation: ✓ (maintains sophisticated understanding of intellectual effort and principled innovation)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear connection to problem-solving and decision-making)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (links personal intellectual development to broader human advancement)
5. Development clarity: ✓ (explains how capacity grows through practice and engagement)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (clear behavioral and outcome indicators)

The reformulation maintains the sophisticated intellectual rigor of the Islamic legal concept while making it accessible as a universal human capacity for principled reasoning and innovation. It preserves the essential balance between respect for established knowledge and creative problem-solving that characterizes the original concept.
