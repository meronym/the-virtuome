Let me analyze and transform Hikmah following the provided framework.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Integration of deep understanding with practical wisdom
Key functions:
- Discernment of underlying principles
- Contextual application of knowledge
- Balance between ideals and practicality
- Integration of multiple perspectives
- Alignment of means with ends

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING
Universal experiences:
- Decision-making in complex situations
- Balancing competing priorities
- Applying principles to practice
- Learning from experience
- Seeing deeper patterns

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary elements:
- Perceptive understanding
- Practical judgment
- Integrative insight
- Contextual awareness
- Purposeful action

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to perceive and apply deep principles within practical contexts, combining profound understanding with skillful action. It manifests as an integrated form of intelligence that unifies insight, judgment, and purposeful implementation while maintaining awareness of both immediate circumstances and ultimate purposes.

[Essential Nature]
Wisdom represents the mature integration of multiple forms of knowing: theoretical understanding, practical experience, pattern recognition, and purposeful judgment. It operates as a dynamic capacity that bridges the gap between abstract principles and concrete situations, enabling responses that honor both universal truths and particular contexts. This quality develops through the progressive refinement of perception, judgment, and action, leading to increasingly sophisticated ways of engaging with complexity while maintaining alignment with fundamental principles.

[Manifestations]
- Clear discernment of underlying patterns and principles in complex situations
- Balanced judgment that considers multiple perspectives and timeframes
- Skillful navigation of competing priorities and demands
- Integration of theoretical knowledge with practical experience
- Alignment of immediate actions with longer-term purposes
- Recognition of appropriate timing and approach in different contexts
- Capacity to identify and implement optimal solutions that serve multiple levels

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous interplay between deep understanding and practical engagement. It develops through repeated cycles of observation, reflection, and action, each cycle deepening both comprehension and effectiveness. The capacity grows through challenging experiences that require integration of multiple forms of knowing, gradually building a sophisticated yet practical grasp of how principles manifest in reality.

In practice, it enables individuals to respond to situations with both depth and practicality, finding solutions that honor fundamental principles while addressing immediate needs. This manifests as an ability to see both the forest and the trees - maintaining awareness of overarching purposes while skillfully handling specific details. The result is action that is both principled and effective, serving both immediate and ultimate ends.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: ✓ (focuses on universal human capacities)
2. Depth preservation: ✓ (maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear connection to real-world situations)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (links personal development to universal principles)
5. Development clarity: ✓ (describes growth process)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (concrete, verifiable expressions)

This universalized description maintains the sophistication of the Islamic concept of Hikmah while making it accessible and relevant across cultural contexts. It preserves the essential integration of deep understanding with practical application while expressing it in terms of universal human experience and development.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this transformation or proceed with another virtue?
