Let me follow the analytical process step by step:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Transformative power of absolute, selfless love
Key functions: 
- Purification of consciousness
- Reorientation of will
- Integration of being
- Transcendence of ego
Systemic role: Ultimate motivating force for spiritual development

2. UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Deep love transcending self-interest
- Transformative power of profound love
- Experience of self-transcendence through love
- Unifying effect of genuine love
Contemporary parallels:
- Peak experiences in positive psychology
- Flow states
- Transformative relationships
- Self-transcendent experiences

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary pattern: Progressive refinement of love from personal to universal
Key dynamics: 
- Purification through attraction to ideal
- Dissolution of ego through genuine care
- Integration through unified purpose
- Expansion of consciousness through love

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for profound love that transcends self-interest, characterized by an attraction to and alignment with the highest good that progressively transforms consciousness, purifies motivation, and expands identity beyond personal boundaries. This love acts as both driving force and destination, simultaneously purifying and fulfilling human nature.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the heart's natural attraction to and resonance with ultimate reality, beauty, and goodness. It manifests as an internal force that progressively refines consciousness through attraction rather than effort, dissolving the limitations of ego-centered existence through genuine care for something greater than oneself. Unlike ordinary affection or attraction, it operates as a transformative power that integrates and elevates all aspects of being through alignment with what is most noble and true.

[Manifestations]
- Deep appreciation and attraction to genuine beauty and goodness in all forms
- Progressive refinement of motivation from personal to universal concern
- Spontaneous service and care arising from genuine love rather than obligation
- Dissolution of internal conflicts through unification of purpose
- Experience of joy and completion in self-transcendent care
- Increasing sensitivity to and resonance with universal principles
- Natural purification of character through attraction to higher ideals

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through progressive attraction to and alignment with higher principles and deeper truth, creating an internal transformation that occurs through love rather than struggle. It begins with glimpses of transcendent beauty or goodness that awaken a deeper yearning, then develops through sustained attraction that gradually purifies motivation and expands consciousness. The ego's normal patterns of self-reference naturally dissolve as genuine care for something greater takes precedence.

In practical expression, this manifests as an increasing capacity to act from genuine care rather than personal interest, experiencing joy and fulfillment in what serves the greater good. Relationships become more authentic, actions more integrated, and consciousness progressively expands beyond personal boundaries. This creates a natural nobility of character and depth of wisdom arising not from discipline but from love's transformative power.

This universalized description aims to:
1. Preserve the transformative depth of the Sufi concept
2. Make it accessible without religious/cultural prerequisites
3. Connect it to universal human experience
4. Maintain practical applicability
5. Capture both individual and universal dimensions

Would you like me to:
1. Further refine any section?
2. Add more practical examples?
3. Elaborate on developmental aspects?
4. Strengthen any particular dimension?
