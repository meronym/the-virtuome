Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Ikhlāṣ:
Core principle: Pure, undivided intention and authenticity of purpose
Key functions:
- Purification of motivation
- Integration of outer/inner
- Elimination of mixed purposes
- Authentication of action
Systemic role: 
- Foundation for authentic development
- Validator of other virtues
- Interface between intention and action

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Internal conflict of mixed motives
- Desire for authentic self-expression
- Struggle with social performance
- Quest for integrity
Contemporary parallels:
- Authenticity in digital age
- Professional integrity
- Personal branding vs genuine expression
- Motivation psychology

3. STRUCTURAL SYNTHESIS:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain pure, undivided intention in thought and action, free from competing motives or hidden agendas. It manifests as a state of internal clarity where action flows from genuine purpose rather than social performance or strategic calculation, resulting in profound congruence between inner truth and outer expression.

[Essential Nature]
Authentic intention represents the integration point between our deepest truth and its expression in the world. It operates as an internal clarifying force, continuously refining our motivations by dissolving secondary purposes and social performances. This quality creates a state of unified purpose where the entire being moves in one direction, free from the fragmentation of competing motives or self-conscious positioning.

The power of authentic intention lies not in rigid control but in the natural alignment that occurs when artificial layers of motivation fall away. It reveals rather than constructs, simplifies rather than adds, and ultimately allows our actions to flow from a place of undivided truthfulness.

[Manifestations]
- Actions performed with complete presence, free from self-consciousness
- Natural congruence between private thought and public behavior
- Ability to maintain purpose regardless of recognition or results
- Freedom from the need to manage others' perceptions
- Spontaneous generosity unmarked by calculation
- Quiet dedication that seeks no validation
- Service performed without need for acknowledgment

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of awareness and intention. Initially, one becomes conscious of the multiple layers of motivation behind actions - social approval, strategic benefit, ego enhancement, genuine purpose. Through sustained self-observation and commitment to truth, these layers begin to dissolve, revealing an underlying unified intention. This process is supported by regular self-examination and the willingness to act without recognition.

In practical terms, authentic intention transforms both the quality of action and the actor's relationship to results. Actions become more effective because energy isn't divided among competing purposes. Internal conflict decreases as artificial motives fall away. Relationships deepen through genuine presence. Perhaps most significantly, one's entire being aligns around core purpose, creating a state of internal harmony that manifests as external grace.
