Let me follow the structured approach to universalize Maʿrifah.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Deep, transformative understanding that unifies intellectual and experiential knowledge
Key functions: Integration of knowledge types, transformation of consciousness, deepening of perception
Relationship patterns: Builds on basic knowledge, leads to wisdom, requires practice and experience
Developmental aspects: Progressive deepening from information to transformation

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- The "aha" moment of deep understanding
- Difference between knowing about vs. truly knowing
- Integration of learning with lived experience
- Transformative insights that change perspective

STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Integration of knowledge types
- Experiential dimension
- Transformative nature
- Progressive deepening

Secondary:
- Practice and contemplation
- Direct experience
- Personal transformation
- Practical wisdom

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Deep understanding that transcends mere information, unifying intellectual knowledge with direct experience and insight. It represents the transformation of knowledge from external information into integrated wisdom that fundamentally changes how we perceive, understand, and interact with reality.

[Essential Nature]
Deep understanding emerges when knowledge moves beyond conceptual grasp to become lived truth. It manifests as a fundamental shift in perception where the knower and the known become intimately connected, transforming both understanding and being. This quality represents the natural progression of human consciousness from collecting information to embodying wisdom.

Unlike surface knowledge, this depth of understanding integrates multiple ways of knowing - intellectual, experiential, intuitive, and practical. It develops through sustained engagement with both study and direct experience, gradually transforming abstract concepts into lived reality.

[Manifestations]
- Ability to perceive deeper patterns and principles underlying surface phenomena
- Natural integration of theoretical knowledge with practical application
- Transformation of intellectual concepts into intuitive understanding
- Capacity to understand things from the inside rather than just observing from outside
- Progressive refinement of perception and discrimination
- Development of wisdom that naturally guides action
- Embodiment of knowledge rather than mere possession of information

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through an organic process of deepening engagement with both knowledge and experience. Initial intellectual understanding is progressively enriched through direct observation, practical application, and contemplative reflection. This integration transforms abstract knowledge into lived wisdom, developing through successive stages of deepening comprehension and expanding awareness.

The practical expression of this quality manifests as natural wisdom in action, where understanding spontaneously guides behavior without need for conscious deliberation. It enables one to grasp the essence of situations directly, see connections between seemingly disparate elements, and respond with appropriate action based on comprehensive understanding rather than mere application of rules or concepts.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural: Uses universal human experiences of learning and understanding
2. Depth: Preserves transformative and integrative aspects
3. Practicality: Clear connection to observable development and application
4. Individual/Universal: Links personal development to universal patterns
5. Development: Clear progression from information to transformation
6. Observable: Concrete manifestations in perception and action

The description maintains the sophisticated nature of the original concept while making it accessible through universal human experiences of learning and understanding. It preserves the transformative aspect central to Maʿrifah while expressing it in phenomenological rather than tradition-specific terms.
