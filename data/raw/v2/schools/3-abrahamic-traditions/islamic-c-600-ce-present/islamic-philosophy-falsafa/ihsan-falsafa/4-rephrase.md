Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Iḥsān:
Core principle: Excellence through consciousness
Key functions: 
- Perfection of action through awareness
- Integration of inner state with outer conduct
- Beautification of behavior
- Optimization of potential
Systemic role: Bridges intention and action, individual and universal

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Striving for excellence
- Flow states
- Conscious competence
- Beauty in action
- Peak performance

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Conscious excellence
- Beautiful action
- Present awareness
- Optimal expression

Secondary:
- Integration of being and doing
- Refinement through practice
- Aesthetic dimension of action
- Developmental continuity

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to perform any action with full consciousness, optimal skill, and inherent beauty, unifying inner awareness with outer excellence. It represents the perfection of both being and doing, where profound presence meets masterful expression in a way that elevates the ordinary to the extraordinary.

[Essential Nature]
Excellence-through-consciousness manifests as a dynamic integration of awareness, skill, and beauty. It emerges when complete presence of mind meets masterful execution, transcending mere technical proficiency to achieve a state where action becomes art. This quality represents the natural flowering of human potential when attention, intention, and action align perfectly.

This state of conscious excellence is characterized by a seamless unity between the doer and the deed, where awareness penetrates every aspect of action, and action itself becomes a perfect expression of awareness. It encompasses both the technical perfection of any activity and its elevation to a higher order of beauty and meaning.

[Manifestations]
- Fluid integration of attention and action in any activity
- Natural grace and appropriateness in behavior and response
- Elevation of ordinary tasks through extraordinary presence
- Beautiful execution that inspires and uplifts others
- Consistent excellence that flows from deep awareness
- Transformation of technical skill into artistic expression
- Harmonious alignment of inner state with outer action

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive refinement of both consciousness and capability. It begins with technical competence, evolves through conscious practice, and culminates in a state where excellence becomes effortless and natural. The deepening of awareness transforms mechanical proficiency into artistic mastery, while continuous refinement of skill provides an ever-more-perfect vehicle for the expression of consciousness.

In practical application, it manifests as the capacity to perform any action - from the mundane to the complex - with full presence, optimal skill, and inherent beauty. This transforms work into craft, craft into art, and art into a vehicle for the expression of universal excellence. The result elevates both the doer and the witness, creating a ripple effect of inspiration and aspiration toward higher quality in all dimensions of life.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the essential Islamic concept of conscious excellence
2. Makes it accessible to any cultural context
3. Maintains both practical and spiritual dimensions
4. Links individual practice to universal principles
5. Provides clear developmental trajectory
6. Offers observable manifestations
7. Retains sophisticated philosophical understanding
8. Emphasizes practical applicability

The description passes the verification questions by:
- Being culturally universal while preserving depth
- Maintaining practical applicability
- Connecting individual to universal
- Providing clear developmental pathway
- Offering observable manifestations
- Remaining true to the original concept's essence
