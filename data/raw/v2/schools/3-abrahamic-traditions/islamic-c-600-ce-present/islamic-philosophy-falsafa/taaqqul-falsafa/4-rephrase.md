Let me follow the process systematically for Ta øaqqul:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Active rational engagement with reality
Key functions:
- Systematic understanding
- Critical examination
- Principled reasoning
- Pattern recognition
- Integration of knowledge

Relationship patterns:
- Foundation for higher wisdom
- Guide for practical action
- Bridge between perception and understanding
- Tool for discernment

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Problem-solving
- Pattern recognition
- Logical analysis
- Critical thinking
- Systematic investigation

Contemporary applications:
- Scientific thinking
- Decision-making
- Learning processes
- Systems analysis

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Active engagement with reality through reason
- Systematic examination of experiences
- Progressive development of understanding
- Integration of knowledge into wisdom

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The active capacity to engage systematically with reality through reasoned investigation, enabling progressive understanding through careful observation, logical analysis, and integrated comprehension. It represents the mind's power to move from surface perception to deeper understanding through disciplined thought.

[Essential Nature]
This quality manifests as the mind's inherent ability to order, analyze, and comprehend experience through systematic investigation. It combines careful observation with logical analysis, pattern recognition with principled reasoning, and critical examination with integrated understanding. Unlike passive reception of information, it represents an active, engaged process of making sense of reality through disciplined mental effort.

[Manifestations]
- Systematic analysis of situations and problems before taking action
- Recognition of patterns and underlying principles in complex situations
- Integration of new information with existing understanding
- Critical examination of assumptions and conclusions
- Progressive development from simple to complex understanding
- Application of logical principles to practical challenges
- Building coherent frameworks of knowledge through careful investigation

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous cycle of observation, analysis, and integration. It begins with careful attention to phenomena, proceeds through systematic examination of patterns and relationships, and culminates in comprehensive understanding. The process involves both breaking down complexity into manageable components and synthesizing insights into coherent frameworks of knowledge.

In practical application, it manifests as the ability to approach challenges methodically, make well-reasoned decisions, and build reliable understanding through systematic investigation. This capacity develops through consistent practice, growing from basic logical analysis to sophisticated systematic thinking that can handle increasing levels of complexity while maintaining clarity and coherence.

This universalization:
- Preserves the active, systematic nature of the original concept
- Makes it accessible across cultural contexts
- Maintains its practical applicability
- Shows clear developmental progression
- Links individual cognitive capacity to universal understanding
- Emphasizes observable manifestations
- Maintains philosophical sophistication while using accessible language

The description satisfies the verification questions by:
1. Using universal human experiences of reasoning and understanding
2. Preserving the depth of systematic investigation and knowledge integration
3. Providing clear practical applications
4. Connecting individual cognitive development to universal understanding
5. Showing clear developmental progression
6. Focusing on observable manifestations in thinking and action
