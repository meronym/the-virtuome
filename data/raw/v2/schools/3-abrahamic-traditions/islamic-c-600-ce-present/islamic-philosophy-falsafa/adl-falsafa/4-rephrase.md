Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF ʿADL:
Core principle: Dynamic equilibrium maintaining right relationships
Key functions:
- Balancing competing interests
- Establishing proper proportions
- Maintaining social harmony
- Ensuring individual rights
- Creating sustainable order

Relationship patterns:
- Between individual rights and collective good

- Between internal character and external action

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Sensing fairness/unfairness
- Balancing competing needs
- Maintaining relationships
- Resolving conflicts
- Distributing resources

Contemporary applications:
- Organizational ethics

3. SYNTHESIZED UNIVERSAL DESCRIPTION:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to perceive, establish, and maintain right relationships and proper proportions across all dimensions of existence. It manifests as an active principle of dynamic equilibrium that harmonizes competing needs and interests while ensuring the appropriate flow of rights, responsibilities, and resources.

[Essential Nature]
Justice operates as a fundamental ordering principle in human experience, functioning simultaneously as an internal compass, an interpersonal regulator, and a cosmic principle of balance. It represents not merely the mechanical application of rules, but a living intelligence that recognizes and maintains optimal relationships between parts within any whole. This quality emerges from deep perception of interconnectedness and manifests as the capacity to establish and maintain conditions where each element receives what it needs to fulfill its nature while contributing appropriately to the whole.

[Manifestations]
Internal:
- Balanced judgment in decision-making
- Emotional equilibrium in challenging situations
- Clear discernment between competing claims
- Self-regulation aligned with higher principles

Interpersonal:
- Fair and considerate treatment of others
- Equitable distribution of resources and opportunities
- Balanced resolution of conflicts
- Recognition and respect for legitimate rights

Systemic:
- Creation of sustainable organizational structures
- Development of equitable social arrangements
- Establishment of balanced ecological relationships
- Maintenance of harmony between tradition and progress

[Functional Description]
Justice operates through a dynamic process of continuous perception, evaluation, and adjustment. It begins with deep attention to the nature of things and their relationships, develops through careful consideration of proper proportions and appropriate measures, and manifests in actions that establish or restore optimal balance. This faculty grows through repeated exposure to situations requiring careful discernment and balanced response, gradually developing from simple fairness to sophisticated understanding of complex systemic relationships.

In practice, justice expresses itself as a combination of clear perception, balanced judgment, and appropriate action. It manifests in the ability to recognize what each situation requires, to weigh competing claims and interests fairly, and to implement solutions that serve the genuine good of all involved. This quality becomes increasingly refined through experience, moving from rigid rule-following to nuanced understanding of how to maintain harmony across multiple dimensions of life.
