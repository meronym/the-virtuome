Let me follow the analytical process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS - Ikhlāṣ
Core principle: Undivided authenticity of intention and action
Key functions:
- Purification of motivation
- Integration of inner/outer states
- Alignment of purpose
- Elimination of mixed motives
Systemic role: 
- Foundation for authentic development
- Qualifier of all actions
- Internal compass

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING
Universal experiences:
- Inner conflict between authentic and social motives
- Desire for genuine self-expression
- Quest for integrity between thought and action
- Recognition of mixed motivations
Contemporary parallels:
- Authenticity in leadership
- Psychological congruence
- Motivational clarity
- Personal integrity

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary:
- State of unified intention
- Clear motivational architecture
- Progressive refinement of purpose
Secondary:
- Social pressure as obstacle
- Self-awareness as foundation
- Clarity as support condition

Now, here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of undivided authenticity in intention and action, where one's outer expression perfectly mirrors inner conviction, free from competing motives or external influences. It represents the integration of purpose, thought, and action into a single, coherent stream of authentic expression.

[Essential Nature]
Authenticity of purpose operates as a unifying force in human consciousness, bringing clarity to motivation and coherence to action. It manifests as an internal state of undivided attention and intention, where the whole being moves in one direction without internal conflict or external distortion. This quality acts as both a purifying agent—clearing away mixed motives and social masks—and an integrating force that aligns thought, feeling, and action into a seamless whole.

[Manifestations]
- Clear, unconflicted decision-making driven by genuine conviction
- Consistent behavior across different social contexts
- Natural alignment between stated values and actual choices
- Absence of performative or impression-managing behaviors
- Progressive refinement of motivation in all undertakings
- Spontaneous authenticity in self-expression
- Resilience against social pressure and external validation

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive recognition and resolution of internal conflicts between authentic impulses and conditioned responses. It begins with awareness of mixed motives, moves through deliberate choice of authentic expression, and matures into spontaneous integrity of being. The process involves both letting go of social masks and crystallizing genuine purpose.

In practical terms, it transforms action by eliminating the energy drain of maintaining appearances or managing impressions. This creates a remarkable efficiency and power in action, as all energy flows in one direction without the friction of internal division. The result is a natural authenticity that others recognize and trust, fostering genuine connection and effective collaboration.

I believe this universalization:
1. Preserves the essential spiritual depth of ikhlāṣ while making it accessible
2. Maintains its practical relevance to contemporary challenges
3. Captures both individual and universal dimensions
4. Charts a clear developmental pathway
5. Describes observable manifestations
6. Retains sophisticated understanding of human consciousness

The description connects to universal human experiences of:
- Seeking authentic self-expression
- Dealing with social pressure
- Managing multiple motivations
- Developing personal integrity
- Integrating inner and outer life

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
