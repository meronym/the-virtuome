Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Iḥsān:
Core principle: Excellence through consciousness
Key functions: 
- Quality enhancement of action
- Spiritual presence/mindfulness
- Beauty manifestation
- Perfection seeking
- Beneficial impact

Relationship patterns:
- Links intention with execution
- Bridges inner state and outer expression
- Connects individual effort to universal harmony
- Integrates consciousness with action

2. UNIVERSALIZATION Analysis:
Universal experiences:
- Striving for excellence
- Moments of full presence/flow
- Beauty creation/appreciation
- Conscious skill mastery
- Service refinement

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary pattern: Consciousness → Refinement → Beauty → Benefit
Development trajectory: Attention → Intention → Execution → Mastery

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The conscious pursuit of excellence through beautiful action, where full presence of mind meets perfection of execution. It represents the marriage of supreme awareness with masterful implementation, creating benefit and beauty through the refinement of every act, whether mundane or sacred.

[Essential Nature]
Excellence-through-presence describes a state of enhanced consciousness that naturally manifests as behavioral refinement and beautiful action. It emerges when complete attention meets intentional action, transforming ordinary activities into expressions of mastery and beauty. This quality represents the natural culmination of conscious development, where awareness becomes so complete that it automatically elevates every action to its highest possible expression.

The quality operates at the intersection of consciousness and action, where heightened awareness naturally produces enhanced performance. Rather than mechanical perfection, it represents organic excellence emerging from complete presence, combining technical mastery with spiritual awareness.

[Manifestations]
- Heightened quality of execution in any task, where technical excellence meets artistic refinement
- Natural grace and appropriateness in action, perfectly suited to each situation
- Complete presence and awareness during activity, eliminating the gap between doer and deed
- Enhanced perception of beauty and opportunity for refinement in every circumstance
- Automatic elevation of ordinary acts through extraordinary consciousness
- Consistent creation of benefit and beauty through daily activities
- Progressive refinement of character through conscious action

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive integration of consciousness with action. It begins with increased awareness during activity, evolves through intentional refinement of execution, and culminates in a state where supreme consciousness naturally produces excellent action. The development process involves both technical skill mastery and expansion of awareness, eventually unifying these into seamless expression.

In practical terms, it manifests as enhanced quality in all undertakings, from artistic creation to professional work to interpersonal interactions. It transforms routine activities into opportunities for excellence and beauty creation, while naturally benefiting others through its expression. This quality produces observable refinement in behavior, measurable improvement in outcomes, and tangible enhancement of environments and relationships.
