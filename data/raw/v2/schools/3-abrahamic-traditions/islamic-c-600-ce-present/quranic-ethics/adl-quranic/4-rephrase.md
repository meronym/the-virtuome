Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF ʿADL
Core principle: Dynamic equilibrium that maintains right relationships
Key functions:
- Balancing competing rights/needs
- Establishing proper proportion
- Maintaining social harmony
- Ensuring equitable distribution
- Correcting imbalances

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING
Universal experiences:
- Sense of fairness/unfairness
- Need for balanced relationships
- Desire for equitable treatment
- Recognition of proportionality
- Experience of harmony/discord

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS
Primary:
- Balance-seeking faculty
- Harmonizing function
- Restorative action
- Systemic equilibrium

Secondary:
- Awareness of interconnection
- Recognition of proper measure
- Active rebalancing
- Sustainable harmony

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The faculty of perceiving, establishing, and maintaining right relationship and proper proportion in all domains of existence. It manifests as the active capacity to recognize imbalance, restore equilibrium, and sustain harmonious interaction between parts within any whole system, whether personal, social, or natural.

[Essential Nature]
Justice operates as a dynamic balancing force that recognizes the inherent dignity and interconnected nature of all beings and systems. It functions through acute awareness of proper proportion, right relationship, and the natural order of things. This faculty combines deep perception of what is due to each part with the active capacity to establish and maintain these proper relationships.

Beyond mere fairness or equality, it represents the positive force that maintains healthy systemic function through continuous dynamic equilibrium. It operates simultaneously as a perceptive faculty that recognizes proper order, an active force that establishes right relationship, and a maintaining power that preserves sustainable harmony.

[Manifestations]
- Acute awareness of proportion and balance in relationships and systems
- Recognition of and appropriate response to inequity or imbalance
- Active restoration of harmony in disturbed relationships or systems
- Establishment of sustainable, mutually beneficial arrangements
- Protection of legitimate rights and boundaries
- Fair and proportional distribution of resources and responsibilities
- Creation of conditions that allow all parts to fulfill their proper function

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a three-fold process: first, through refined perception that recognizes proper order and relationship; second, through clear discernment of current imbalances or distortions; and third, through active engagement to restore and maintain equilibrium. It requires constant attention to changing conditions and dynamic adjustment to maintain optimal balance, much like a skilled acrobat maintaining perfect poise through continuous micro-adjustments.

In practical expression, this manifests as the capacity to create and maintain conditions where all parts of a system can fulfill their proper function while supporting the whole. It shows up in fair dealings, equitable distribution, protection of rights, proper attention to responsibilities, and the establishment of sustainable, harmonious relationships. At its highest expression, it creates conditions where all beings and systems can thrive in mutual support.

This universalization:
- Preserves the dynamic, active nature of ʿAdl
- Captures both individual and systemic dimensions
- Maintains the sophistication of the original concept
- Makes it accessible through universal experiences
- Emphasizes practical manifestation
- Links personal, social, and cosmic dimensions
- Highlights developmental aspects
- Provides clear markers for observation/verification

The description should be meaningful across cultures while maintaining the depth and sophistication of the Islamic concept of ʿAdl, making it both practically applicable and philosophically sound.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
