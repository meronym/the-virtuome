Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS (Da'at):
Core principle: Integrated, living knowledge that unifies understanding and experience
Key functions: 
- Bridges theoretical and practical understanding
- Transforms information into wisdom
- Enables effective action
- Develops discernment
- Facilitates personal growth

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Moving from knowledge to understanding
- Integrating theory and practice
- Developing deep comprehension
- Making wise decisions
- Growing in discernment

Parallel concepts:
- Practical wisdom (phronesis)
- Integrated understanding
- Embodied knowledge
- Deep comprehension
- Applied wisdom

Here's the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to deeply understand and effectively apply knowledge, transforming theoretical comprehension into practical wisdom through integration of intellectual understanding, experiential learning, and refined judgment. This quality enables discerning perception and wise action across all domains of life.

[Essential Nature]
Living knowledge represents the transformation of information and experience into integrated understanding that shapes perception, guides action, and enables wisdom. Unlike mere accumulation of facts or theoretical understanding, it manifests as a dynamic capacity that unifies knowing and doing, combining clear comprehension with practical effectiveness.

This quality develops through the continuous interplay between intellectual understanding and direct experience, gradually maturing into an intuitive grasp of principles and their applications. It enables both deep insight and practical wisdom, serving as the foundation for discerning judgment and effective action.

[Manifestations]
- Clear discernment between essential and secondary aspects of situations
- Natural integration of theoretical understanding with practical application
- Capacity to recognize underlying patterns and principles
- Ability to adapt knowledge appropriately to context
- Wisdom in decision-making and action
- Development of nuanced understanding through experience
- Growing capacity to teach and transmit understanding to others

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous cycle of learning, integration, and application. As theoretical knowledge meets practical experience, it transforms into embodied understanding. This process refines perception, develops intuitive grasp of principles, and enables increasingly sophisticated discernment. The quality grows through active engagement with both ideas and their applications, supported by reflection on experience and openness to deeper understanding.

In practical expression, it manifests as the ability to see clearly, judge wisely, and act effectively across various life situations. It enables appropriate response to complex circumstances, facilitates teaching and mentoring others, and supports continuous personal development. This quality bridges the gap between knowledge and wisdom, theory and practice, understanding and action, serving as a fundamental capacity for human development and effective living.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: Yes - describes universal human capacity for developing wisdom
2. Preserves depth: Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear connection to action and development
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - links personal development to universal capacity
5. Developmental clarity: Yes - describes process of growth and integration
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - clear behavioral and functional indicators

The description maintains the sophistication of Maimonides' concept while making it accessible and relevant across cultural contexts. It preserves the integration of theoretical and practical aspects while expressing them in universal terms.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this description to better meet the objectives?
