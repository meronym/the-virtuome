Let me follow the process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Active engagement with worthwhile pursuits
Functions: 
- Energizes purposeful action
- Overcomes inertia/procrastination
- Maintains momentum in development
- Bridges intention and action
Systemic role: Activating force for other virtues

2. UNIVERSALIZATION
Universal experiences:
- The gap between knowing and doing
- The feeling of energetic engagement
- The struggle with procrastination
- The satisfaction of prompt action
Parallel concepts:
- "Flow state" in psychology
- "Initiative" in leadership
- "Diligence" in work ethics
- "Activation energy" in change processes

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary Elements:
- Energetic engagement with worthy goals
- Prompt response to opportunities
- Sustained effort over time
- Catalyst for development

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of energetic engagement that bridges intention and action, characterized by prompt response to opportunity and sustained effort toward worthy goals. It manifests as the vital force that transforms knowledge into practice and potential into achievement, maintaining momentum in personal development and ethical action.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the activating force in human development - the capacity to overcome inertia and engage promptly and sustainably with worthwhile pursuits. It operates at the crucial intersection between understanding and action, providing the energy that transforms insight into practice and intention into achievement. Unlike mere hurriedness or superficial activity, it embodies purposeful, sustained engagement directed toward genuine growth and meaningful accomplishment.

[Manifestations]
- Prompt initiation of beneficial actions without delay or hesitation
- Sustained engagement with challenging tasks despite obstacles
- Consistent follow-through on commitments and responsibilities
- Regular, rhythmic patterns of productive activity
- Swift recovery and re-engagement after interruptions or setbacks
- Energetic pursuit of learning and growth opportunities
- Balanced urgency that neither rushes nor procrastinates

[Functional Description]
This quality operates as a catalytic force in human development, activating potential and transforming static knowledge into dynamic practice. It functions by generating an initial surge of energy to overcome inertia, then maintaining a steady flow of engagement that sustains progress. The quality calibrates itself to the task at hand, providing appropriate levels of activation without falling into either frantic activity or sluggish delay.

In practical expression, it manifests as a characteristic readiness to engage with valuable opportunities, combined with the staying power to see things through to completion. This creates a distinctive pattern of life marked by timely beginnings, steady progress, and reliable completion of worthwhile undertakings. The quality builds momentum over time, making subsequent activation progressively easier and creating an upward spiral of accomplished action.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the core Maimonidean insight about the importance of active engagement
2. Translates it into phenomenological language accessible across cultures
3. Maintains both theoretical depth and practical applicability
4. Connects individual experience to universal patterns
5. Describes observable manifestations
6. Provides clear development pathway

The description should be meaningful across cultures while preserving the essential depth of the original Maimonidean concept. It emphasizes practical applicability while maintaining philosophical sophistication.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
