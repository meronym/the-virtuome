Let me analyze Yedi'at HaShem through this framework:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
- Core: Integration of intellectual understanding and experiential wisdom
- Function: Ultimate human development/realization
- Systemic role: Organizing principle for all knowledge/development
- Developmental: Progressive deepening of understanding/awareness

UNIVERSAL ELEMENTS:
- Quest for ultimate understanding
- Integration of knowledge and being
- Transformative wisdom
- Unity of theory and practice
- Peak human potential

Here's the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The progressive development and integration of deep understanding, where intellectual comprehension merges with experiential wisdom to reveal fundamental patterns of reality. This integration transforms both knowing and being, leading to enhanced perception, ethical refinement, and actualization of human potential.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the highest synthesis of human cognitive and experiential capabilities. It manifests as a dynamic interaction between analytical understanding and direct insight, where each level of comprehension transforms the entire framework of perception and action. Unlike purely theoretical knowledge or merely practical wisdom, it represents the complete integration of understanding and being.

This integration operates across multiple dimensions - intellectual, experiential, ethical, and practical - creating a coherent and ever-deepening grasp of reality's fundamental patterns. It transforms not just what one knows, but how one knows, leading to qualitatively different modes of perception and engagement with reality.

[Manifestations]
- Progressive refinement of perception, seeing deeper patterns in apparently ordinary phenomena
- Natural integration of understanding into action, where knowledge spontaneously shapes behavior
- Enhanced capacity to recognize fundamental principles across diverse contexts
- Development of nuanced ethical judgment based on deep pattern recognition
- Increasing harmony between theoretical understanding and practical wisdom
- Growing ability to communicate complex insights in accessible ways
- Spontaneous expression of wisdom in daily life without conscious effort

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a reciprocal process where intellectual understanding informs direct experience, while experience reshapes and deepens understanding. Each advance in either domain catalyzes development in the other, creating an upward spiral of development. The process requires both active investigation and receptive contemplation, combining rigorous analysis with intuitive insight.

In practical terms, this manifests as increasingly sophisticated pattern recognition across all domains of life, leading to more effective action and deeper understanding. The individual becomes progressively more capable of recognizing universal principles in particular situations, responding with appropriate action that stems from integrated wisdom rather than merely applied knowledge. This results in naturally ethical behavior, enhanced problem-solving capabilities, and the ability to navigate complex situations with clarity and precision.

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural? Yes - focuses on universal human capacity for understanding
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophistication while removing religious specificity
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear manifestations and development path
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal development to universal patterns
5. Development clear? Yes - describes progressive integration process
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - listed concrete expressions

This reformulation maintains the sophisticated developmental framework of Maimonides while making it accessible to those outside the Jewish theological tradition. It preserves the integration of theoretical and practical wisdom that was central to his thought while expressing it in universal terms.
