[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain active trust and demonstrate reliable faithfulness, combining deep confidence with proven dependability. It manifests as the ability to sustain commitments despite uncertainty while building and proving trustworthiness through consistent action and unwavering presence.

[Essential Nature]
Active trust represents a dynamic interplay between confidence and reliability, where deep conviction meets demonstrated dependability. It operates as both an internal state of sustained confidence and an external demonstration of trustworthiness, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of reliability and trust. This quality enables stable relationships and commitments by bridging uncertainty with consistent action, transforming abstract confidence into concrete reliability.

[Manifestations]
- Maintaining commitments despite challenges or uncertainty
- Demonstrating consistent reliability in word and action
- Building trust through repeated proof of dependability
- Sustaining confidence in face of incomplete information
- Converting abstract trust into concrete action
- Establishing patterns of reliable presence and support

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a progressive cycle of testing and validation, where initial trust enables committed action, which then proves reliability, strengthening future trust. It begins as potential, grows through challenge, and matures through demonstrated consistency, creating an expanding capacity for both trusting and being trustworthy.

In practical application, it manifests as the ability to maintain stable relationships, build reliable institutions, and create sustainable communities. It operates by transforming uncertainty into confidence through consistent action, while simultaneously developing personal reliability that others can depend upon. This dual nature - being both trustworthy and able to trust - creates foundations for all forms of human cooperation and commitment.
