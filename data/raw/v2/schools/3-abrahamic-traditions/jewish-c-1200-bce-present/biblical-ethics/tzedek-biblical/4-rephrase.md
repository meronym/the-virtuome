Let me work through this systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Tzedek/Tzedakah
Core principle: Integration of personal righteousness with social justice
Key functions:
- Alignment of individual conduct with universal moral law
- Active restoration of social harmony/balance
- Practical manifestation of ethical principles
- Bridge between moral truth and social action

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING
Universal experiences:
- Recognition of fairness/unfairness
- Desire for social harmony
- Impulse to correct imbalances
- Tension between personal and collective good
- Need for systematic moral framework

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Ethical consciousness translated into action
- Personal virtue expressing through social responsibility
- Dynamic balance between justice and compassion
- Integration of moral truth with practical reality

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The active alignment of personal conduct and social structures with universal moral principles, expressed through both individual righteousness and systematic pursuit of social justice. This quality integrates moral consciousness with practical action, maintaining dynamic balance between justice and compassion.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the human capacity to recognize, pursue, and implement moral truth through both personal conduct and social engagement. It manifests as an active force that seeks to align reality with ethical ideals, operating simultaneously at individual and collective levels. Unlike passive moral awareness, it demands concrete action to address imbalances and establish just relationships.

The quality combines acute moral sensitivity with practical wisdom, creating a bridge between ethical understanding and effective action. It encompasses both the maintenance of existing just arrangements and the transformation of unjust conditions, guided by universal principles but adapted to specific contexts.

[Manifestations]
- Personal integrity in daily conduct and relationships
- Active intervention to protect vulnerable individuals and groups
- Systematic addressing of social inequities through sustainable solutions
- Fair and ethical management of resources and responsibilities
- Development of just systems and structures
- Integration of compassion with principled action
- Regular self-examination of one's role in maintaining social justice

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous cycle of moral awareness, ethical judgment, and practical action. It begins with recognition of moral truth and extends through personal transformation to social engagement. The process involves constant refinement of both understanding and implementation, developing increasingly sophisticated responses to complex ethical challenges while maintaining fundamental principles.

In practice, this quality manifests as a consistent pattern of ethical decision-making and action across all life domains. It shapes personal conduct, professional choices, and social engagement, creating a coherent expression of moral truth through practical action. The quality develops through conscious practice, challenging experiences, and systematic reflection, gradually building capacity for more effective ethical action.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the integration of personal righteousness and social justice central to tzedek
2. Maintains the active/practical emphasis of the original concept
3. Translates the theological framework into universal ethical principles
4. Retains the systematic/comprehensive nature of the original
5. Keeps the dynamic tension between justice and compassion
6. Emphasizes both individual and collective dimensions
7. Maintains focus on practical implementation

The description should be:
- Meaningful across cultural contexts
- Practically applicable
- True to the original depth
- Clear in developmental aspects
- Observable in manifestation
- Relevant to contemporary challenges

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
