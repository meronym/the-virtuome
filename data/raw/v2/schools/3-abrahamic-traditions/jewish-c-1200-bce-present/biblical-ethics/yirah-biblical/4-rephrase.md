Let me work through this systematically for Yirah:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Conscious recognition of the sublime/transcendent
Key functions: 
- Generates appropriate response to greatness/mystery
- Calibrates self-perception within larger context
- Guides ethical behavior through awareness
- Cultivates depth of experience/meaning

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Encounter with natural wonders
- Recognition of life's profound mysteries
- Awareness of knowledge limitations
- Experience of transcendent beauty
- Sense of cosmic scale

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary elements:
- Recognition faculty
- Response pattern
- Behavioral guidance
- Experiential depth

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize and appropriately respond to encounters with greatness, whether in nature, knowledge, beauty, or moral truth. This faculty combines deep awareness with profound respect, generating both humility and elevation while guiding behavior through recognition of what transcends ordinary experience.

[Essential Nature]
Reverent awareness represents a fundamental human capacity to perceive and respond to what exceeds ordinary understanding or control. It manifests as a distinct kind of consciousness that combines recognition of greatness with appropriate response - neither collapsing into fear nor dissolving into casual familiarity. This faculty serves as an essential calibration mechanism for human consciousness, establishing proper relationship with what transcends us while maintaining engaged presence rather than withdrawal.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous recognition of natural majesty (mountains, oceans, cosmos)
- Deepened perception in encounters with profound knowledge or wisdom
- Appropriate humility combined with dignity in face of mystery
- Enhanced ethical sensitivity through awareness of action consequences
- Capacity to maintain wonder while developing understanding
- Recognition of limits combined with inspiration to grow
- Balance of deep respect with engaged investigation

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a distinct mode of perception that recognizes the extraordinary within and beyond ordinary experience. It activates when encountering genuine greatness, producing a characteristic combination of withdrawal and attraction, respect and fascination. This creates optimal conditions for growth by maintaining appropriate relationship with what exceeds current understanding while preserving engagement.

In practical expression, it manifests as the capacity to remain fully present to what transcends us without either collapsing into fear or defaulting to false familiarity. This enables deep learning, ethical development, and genuine appreciation of beauty and truth. It guides behavior through awareness of the profound dimensions of existence while fostering both humility and dignity in human development.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Yes - based on universal human experiences
2. Preserves depth: Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear manifestations and functional description
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - links personal experience to universal phenomena
5. Development clarity: Yes - shows how the quality grows and operates
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - clear behavioral and experiential markers

The universalization maintains the core insights of the Biblical Yirah while making them accessible across cultural contexts. It preserves the sophisticated understanding of how this faculty operates while grounding it in common human experience.

Would you like me to expand on any aspect of this universalization?
