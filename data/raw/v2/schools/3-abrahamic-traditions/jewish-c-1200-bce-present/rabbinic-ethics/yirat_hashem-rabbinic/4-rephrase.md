Let me approach this systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Yirat Hashem:
Core principle: Existential awareness leading to ethical consciousness
Key functions: 
- Creates moral framework
- Enables perspective-taking beyond ego
- Generates sense of purpose and meaning
- Motivates ethical behavior
- Cultivates humility and wonder

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Encounter with vastness/mystery
- Sense of transcendent meaning
- Ethical intuition/moral compass
- Recognition of human limitations
- Experience of profound wonder

3. STRUCTURAL PATTERNS:
- Develops from simple awe to mature ethical awareness
- Combines emotional and intellectual elements
- Manifests in both internal state and external behavior
- Creates framework for meaning-making

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for profound existential awareness that combines deep wonder at life's magnitude with acute consciousness of ethical responsibility. This awareness generates both humility and moral courage, fostering a state of mindful presence that informs choices and behaviors through recognition of life's sacred dimension.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the human capacity to perceive and respond to existence's profound depth and ethical implications. It manifests as a dynamic combination of wonder and responsibility, where awareness of life's vastness generates both humility and purposeful engagement. Unlike simple emotional reactions, it develops into a stable perspective that integrates cognitive understanding with experiential wisdom, creating a foundation for ethical behavior and meaningful action.

This awareness serves as an internal compass, providing both motivation for ethical conduct and a framework for understanding one's place within a larger context. It transforms abstract moral principles into felt reality, making ethical behavior not just a duty but a natural response to perceived truth.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous sense of wonder at natural phenomena and human experience
- Careful consideration before important decisions or actions
- Natural resistance to ethical compromises
- Heightened awareness of potential consequences of actions
- Capacity to maintain perspective in challenging situations
- Recognition of dignity and worth in all beings
- Balance of confidence with humility in leadership roles

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dual process of expansion and focusing: expansion of awareness to include broader contexts and deeper meanings, combined with focusing of attention on immediate ethical implications. It develops through exposure to both natural wonder and ethical challenges, gradually building an integrated perspective that combines emotional depth with practical wisdom. The mature expression involves constant interplay between expansive awareness and focused practical judgment.

In daily life, this quality manifests as heightened ethical sensitivity combined with practical wisdom. It enables one to navigate complex situations with both principle and pragmatism, maintaining consistency between values and actions. This creates a characteristic pattern of behavior marked by careful consideration, ethical reliability, and genuine concern for consequences, while retaining flexibility and practical effectiveness in varying circumstances.

This universal description aims to:
- Preserve the depth of Yirat Hashem's spiritual dimension
- Make it accessible without religious framework
- Maintain practical applicability
- Connect individual experience to universal patterns
- Retain sophistication of the original concept
- Enable cross-cultural understanding and application

The description emphasizes phenomenological experience over theoretical framework, making it accessible while preserving the essential transformative power of the original concept.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this universalization process or the resulting description?
