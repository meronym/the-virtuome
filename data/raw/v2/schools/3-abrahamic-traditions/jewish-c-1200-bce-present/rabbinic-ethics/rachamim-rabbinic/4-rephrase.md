Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF RACHAMIM:
Core principle: Active compassion combining emotional resonance with practical response
Key functions: 
- Emotional attunement to suffering
- Balanced judgment in response
- Motivation for helping action
- Bridge between justice and mercy
- Channel for divine-like care

Universal experiences:
- Recognition of shared vulnerability
- Impulse to alleviate suffering
- Balance between heart and mind in helping
- Transformation of empathy into action
- Care-based decision making

Here's my attempt at the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to deeply recognize and be moved by the suffering of others, combined with the wisdom to respond effectively. It manifests as the seamless integration of emotional sensitivity and practical action, transforming empathetic awareness into meaningful support while maintaining balanced judgment.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the mature development of human empathetic capacity, where emotional resonance with others' difficulties evolves beyond mere feeling into wise, effective response. It combines immediate emotional recognition with considered action, transcending both cold rationality and pure emotional reaction. The quality operates as a bridge between empathetic awareness and practical care, manifesting as a form of emotional wisdom that guides appropriate helping behavior.

Unlike simple empathy or sympathy, this quality includes the development of judgment about how best to help, when to act, and what form assistance should take. It maintains awareness of both immediate needs and longer-term wellbeing, balancing heart and mind in service of genuine care.

[Manifestations]
- Immediate emotional attunement to others' distress combined with careful consideration of response
- Balanced integration of justice and mercy in dealing with others' failures or mistakes
- Practical helping actions that address both immediate needs and long-term wellbeing
- Capacity to maintain emotional presence while taking effective action
- Development of wisdom about different forms of suffering and appropriate responses
- Recognition of shared human vulnerability while maintaining strength to help
- Creation of environments and systems that support both emotional safety and growth

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive integration of emotional sensitivity and practical wisdom. Initially emerging as simple empathetic response, it matures through experience with different forms of suffering and helping, developing increasingly sophisticated understanding of how to transform emotional recognition into effective support. The quality requires constant balancing of heart and mind, immediate response and considered action, individual care and broader perspective.

In practice, it manifests as a form of emotional intelligence that guides helping behavior across contexts. It enables rapid recognition of suffering combined with wise discernment about appropriate response, whether through direct action, emotional support, practical assistance, or creation of supportive conditions. This quality helps create environments where both vulnerability and growth are possible, supporting individual and collective development through balanced care.
```

This reformulation aims to:
- Preserve the sophisticated integration of emotion and action from the original concept
- Make the quality recognizable across cultural contexts
- Maintain practical applicability
- Connect individual experience to universal human patterns
- Describe clear developmental trajectory
- Specify observable manifestations
- Retain the wisdom aspect while removing specific religious references

Would you like me to examine any aspect in more detail or adjust the formulation in any way?
