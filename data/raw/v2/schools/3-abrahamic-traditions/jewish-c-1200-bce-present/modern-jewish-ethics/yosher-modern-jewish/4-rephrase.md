Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Yosher:
Core principle: Ethical uprightness that transcends formal requirements
Functions: Moral intuition, ethical decision-making, fairness in dealings
Systemic role: Bridges formal rules and ethical spirit
Developmental: Progresses from rule-following to internalized ethical intuition

2. UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences: Moral decision-making, ethical dilemmas, fairness
Parallel concepts: Integrity, moral compass, ethical intelligence
Contemporary relevance: Business ethics, professional conduct, personal integrity
Timeless patterns: The gap between rules and right action

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary elements:
- Core: Active ethical consciousness
- Manifestation: Consistent ethical behavior beyond requirements
- Development: From external guidance to internalized wisdom
- Relationships: Connects personal integrity to social harmony

Here's my universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Ethical intelligence that naturally perceives and acts upon what is right beyond formal requirements. This quality manifests as an internalized moral compass that guides behavior toward genuine fairness and integrity, bridging the gap between rules and their intended spirit.

[Essential Nature]
Ethical intelligence operates as an integrated capacity combining moral intuition, practical wisdom, and principled action. It transcends mere rule-following by developing a refined sensitivity to the ethical dimension of situations, enabling responses that honor both the letter and spirit of moral principles. This quality represents the maturation of moral consciousness from external compliance to internalized wisdom, expressing itself through consistent ethical behavior that naturally aligns with genuine fairness and human dignity.

[Manifestations]
- Naturally choosing fair solutions in complex situations
- Making ethical decisions without needing external guidance
- Going beyond minimal requirements to do what is truly right
- Maintaining consistent integrity across all contexts
- Intuiting and addressing ethical implications others might miss
- Finding balanced solutions that honor all parties' dignity
- Demonstrating practical wisdom in applying principles to reality

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of moral sensitivity and ethical judgment. Beginning with conscious adherence to ethical principles, it evolves through repeated ethical decision-making into an internalized wisdom that operates automatically. This development transforms explicit moral reasoning into implicit ethical intuition, much like how practiced skills become natural abilities.

In practice, it manifests as consistent ethical behavior that others experience as natural fairness and integrity. Rather than calculating minimal requirements or following rules mechanically, this quality enables fluid ethical responses that honor the deeper purpose of moral principles while adapting appropriately to context. It creates trust through reliability and demonstrates how ethical behavior can become a natural expression of character rather than an imposed obligation.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? Yes - focuses on universal human experience of ethical development
2. Preserves depth? Yes - captures both practical and developmental aspects
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear manifestations and developmental path
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal development to universal ethical principles
5. Development clear? Yes - describes progression from conscious to intuitive
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - concrete behavioral indicators provided

The reformulation maintains the sophisticated ethical framework of Yosher while making it accessible to those without Jewish cultural context. It preserves the essential insight about ethical behavior transcending mere rule-following while expressing it in universal experiential terms.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this reformulation?
