Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS (Emet):
Core principle: Truth-commitment as active engagement with reality
Key functions: 
- Alignment of inner/outer reality
- Foundation for trust/reliability
- Basis for genuine understanding
- Guide for authentic action

Relationship patterns:
- Underpins all other virtues
- Creates basis for relationships
- Enables genuine growth
- Facilitates collective wisdom

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Seeking understanding
- Distinguishing real from false
- Building trust
- Finding authentic expression
- Confronting reality

Contemporary relevance:
- Information age challenges
- "Post-truth" discourse
- Scientific integrity
- Personal authenticity
- Institutional transparency

Now, the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Truth-commitment is the active alignment of understanding, speech, and action with reality as it is, rather than as we wish it to be. It manifests as radical honesty with oneself, faithful representation in communication, and unwavering dedication to seeing and expressing what is real, even when uncomfortable or challenging.

[Essential Nature]
Truth-commitment operates as both a perceptual capacity and an ethical stance. As a perceptual capacity, it enables clear seeing of reality without distortion from wishful thinking, fear, or bias. As an ethical stance, it demands consistent alignment between what we perceive, what we say, and what we do. This quality creates a foundation of reliability and authenticity in both personal development and human relationships.

The power of truth-commitment lies not in rigid adherence to facts alone, but in maintaining a dynamic relationship with reality that encompasses both objective observation and subjective meaning-making. It requires courage to face what is, wisdom to understand context and complexity, and integrity to represent findings faithfully.

[Manifestations]
- Intellectual honesty: Willing examination of evidence even when it challenges existing beliefs
- Communicative integrity: Accurate and contextual sharing of information without distortion
- Personal authenticity: Alignment between inner experience and outer expression
- Reality acceptance: Capacity to acknowledge and work with situations as they actually are
- Truth-seeking behavior: Active investigation and verification rather than passive acceptance
- Reliable presence: Being consistently trustworthy and dependable in word and action
- Transparent engagement: Open sharing of relevant information and clear accountability

[Functional Description]
Truth-commitment develops through progressive refinement of perception, communication, and action. It begins with basic honesty in speech and extends to deeper levels of self-awareness and reality-testing. As it matures, it becomes an integrated approach to life that naturally seeks clarity, abhors deception, and maintains unwavering fidelity to what is real. This development requires constant practice in distinguishing truth from falsehood, genuine from artificial, and essential from superficial.

In practical terms, truth-commitment manifests as careful attention to accuracy in speech, willingness to acknowledge errors, active verification of information before sharing, and consistent alignment between stated principles and actual behavior. It creates environments of trust, enables genuine learning and growth, and forms the foundation for meaningful relationships and effective collaboration. In leadership and social contexts, it builds credibility and enables authentic influence through demonstrated reliability and transparent engagement.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: ✓ (focuses on universal human experiences with truth)
2. Preservation of depth: ✓ (maintains philosophical sophistication while being accessible)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear behavioral manifestations and development path)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (links personal practice to collective impact)
5. Development clarity: ✓ (shows progression from basic to sophisticated practice)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (concrete, verifiable behaviors and outcomes)

This universalized description maintains the essence of Emet while making it accessible and relevant across cultural contexts. It preserves the philosophical depth of the Jewish concept while expressing it in phenomenological rather than theological terms.
