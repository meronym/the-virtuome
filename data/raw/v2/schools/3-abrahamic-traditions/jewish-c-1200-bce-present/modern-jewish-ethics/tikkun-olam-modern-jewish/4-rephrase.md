Let me work through this systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS - Tikkun Olam
Core principle: Transformative responsibility for world improvement
Key functions:
- Individual moral agency
- Collective responsibility
- Systemic transformation
- Practical improvement
- Integration of ideal and real

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING
Universal experiences:
- Recognition of imperfection/brokenness
- Desire to improve conditions
- Sense of responsibility
- Agency in affecting change
- Connection between personal and collective transformation

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS
Primary:
- Active engagement with world improvement
- Integration of personal and collective transformation
- Practical action toward ideal conditions
- Progressive/developmental nature

Secondary:
- Balance of idealism and pragmatism
- Sustainable long-term engagement
- Integration of multiple levels of impact
- Collective coordination

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The active participation in world-improvement through the integration of personal development and social transformation. A dynamic commitment to identifying, addressing, and healing imperfections in human systems and conditions while recognizing the interconnection between individual growth and collective progress.

[Essential Nature]
This quality manifests as a fundamental recognition of both the world's incompleteness and human capacity to participate in its improvement. It combines practical action with visionary aspiration, engaging individuals in an ongoing process of identifying what needs healing or enhancement and taking concrete steps toward positive change. The quality operates simultaneously at personal, interpersonal, and systemic levels, recognizing that genuine transformation requires coordination across these dimensions.

[Manifestations]
- Practical engagement in addressing social issues
- Integration of personal growth with collective improvement
- Sustainable long-term commitment to positive change
- Recognition and response to systemic patterns
- Balance of idealistic vision with pragmatic action
- Coordination of individual and collective efforts
- Development of transformative practices and systems

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay between awareness and action, where recognition of what needs improvement catalyzes practical engagement. It develops through progressive stages: from initial awareness of imperfection, through experimental attempts at improvement, to sophisticated understanding of systemic change and sustainable transformation. The quality grows through practical experience while maintaining connection to idealistic vision.

In practice, this manifests as sustained engagement in activities that contribute to positive change, whether through direct service, system improvement, or cultural transformation. It requires balancing immediate needs with long-term vision, coordinating personal capacity with collective effort, and maintaining hope and commitment while facing significant challenges. Success is measured not just in immediate outcomes but in the development of sustainable patterns of positive change.

This universalized description:
- Preserves the core transformative aspect of Tikkun Olam
- Maintains practical applicability
- Connects individual to universal dimensions
- Describes observable manifestations
- Outlines development patterns
- Remains accessible while maintaining sophistication
- Avoids culture-specific references while preserving depth
- Emphasizes practical engagement and systemic understanding
- Acknowledges both immediate and long-term aspects
- Integrates personal and collective dimensions

The description should be meaningful across cultures while maintaining the essential depth and practical applicability of the original concept. It connects individual agency to collective transformation and provides clear paths for development and application.
