2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:

- Desire for fairness in relationships
- Need for systemic harmony
- Tension between ideal and real

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Primary:
- Core: Active rebalancing force
- Manifestation: Intervention in inequitable situations
- Development: Personal → interpersonal → systemic

Here's the universal description following the requested format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The active force of righteous rebalancing in human affairs, manifesting as the recognition of and response to inequity at all scales. It operates as both an internal compass for fairness and an external imperative for systemic transformation, driving the continuous restoration of harmony in human relationships and social structures.

[Essential Nature]
This quality functions as a dynamic equilibrium-seeking force in human consciousness and society. It begins as an intuitive recognition of imbalance or unfairness, develops into a moral imperative for action, and matures into a sustained commitment to creating and maintaining just relationships and systems. Unlike passive awareness or theoretical ideals, it necessarily involves active engagement with inequity at both personal and structural levels.

The quality combines acute discernment of what is out of balance with the courageous initiative to restore harmony. It operates simultaneously as internal virtue and external practice, personal characteristic and social force, immediate response and long-term commitment.

[Manifestations]
- Immediate recognition of and response to unfair situations
- Consistent choices that favor equity over personal advantage
- Active support for those experiencing injustice or inequality
- Initiative in identifying and addressing systemic imbalances
- Creation and maintenance of fair processes and structures
- Development of inclusive and equitable relationships
- Leadership in transforming unjust conditions or systems

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive stages of awareness and engagement. It begins with personal sensitivity to fairness in immediate interactions, expands to recognition of broader patterns of inequity, and matures into systematic understanding of justice as a dynamic force for social harmony. The development process requires both increasing awareness of interconnection and growing capacity for effective action.

In practice, it manifests as a combination of acute discernment and courageous initiative. At the personal level, it guides individual choices and relationships toward greater fairness. At the systemic level, it drives the creation and reformation of structures to better serve collective wellbeing. Its impact is measured not in abstract ideals but in concrete improvements to human relationships and social conditions.
