```markdown
[Core Definition]
Truth-alignment: the active cultivation of complete congruence between inner reality and outer expression, encompassing accurate perception, authentic communication, and genuine being. This fundamental quality enables clear seeing, honest expression, and authentic living across all dimensions of human experience.

[Essential Nature]
Truth-alignment operates as a dynamic force for coherence and authenticity in human experience. It manifests as an active principle that continuously aligns perception, understanding, and expression with reality at all levels - from factual accuracy to existential truth. This quality serves as both a foundation for genuine development and a compass for navigation through complexity.

Unlike simple truthfulness, truth-alignment represents a comprehensive integration of knowing, being, and expressing. It requires constant engagement with reality as it is, rather than as we might wish it to be, while maintaining the courage to face and communicate what we discover.

[Manifestations]
- Clear perception: ability to see reality accurately, free from distortion
- Internal coherence: alignment between thoughts, feelings, and actions
- Authentic expression: genuine communication without pretense
- Active inquiry: ongoing investigation into truth at all levels
- Reality engagement: direct confrontation with facts and circumstances
- Existential honesty: facing fundamental truths about self and existence
- Integral accuracy: maintaining truthfulness across all life dimensions

[Functional Description]
Truth-alignment develops through progressive refinement of perception and expression. Beginning with basic factual honesty, it evolves through increasingly subtle levels of self-awareness and reality-testing. This quality acts as both a cleansing force - removing distortions and self-deception - and a constructive force, building integrity and authentic presence. It requires continuous practice of honest self-reflection, courage to face uncomfortable truths, and commitment to genuine expression.

In practical application, truth-alignment manifests as clarity in communication, integrity in relationships, accuracy in work, and authenticity in self-expression. It enables trusted connections, reliable judgment, and genuine personal growth. This quality provides essential foundation for all forms of human development, from practical skill-building to spiritual advancement, by ensuring that growth is based on real understanding rather than illusion or wishful thinking.
