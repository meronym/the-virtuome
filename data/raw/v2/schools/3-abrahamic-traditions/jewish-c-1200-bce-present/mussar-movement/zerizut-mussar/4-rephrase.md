Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Zerizut:
Core principle: Active engagement with life's demands and opportunities
Functions: Overcoming inertia, maintaining momentum, energizing action
Systemic role: Gateway virtue enabling other developments
Developmental aspects: Progresses from external to internal motivation

2. UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- The contrast between procrastination and immediate action
- The feeling of being fully engaged vs sluggish
- The experience of overcoming internal resistance
- The momentum that builds from consistent action

Contemporary relevance:
- Digital age attention management
- Professional effectiveness
- Personal development
- Life-work integration

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary qualities:
- Energetic responsiveness
- Sustained engagement
- Proactive orientation
- Internal motivation

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Dynamic responsiveness to life's calls for action, characterized by ready engagement and sustained momentum. This quality manifests as the capacity to move promptly from recognition to action, overcoming internal resistance while maintaining enthusiasm and effectiveness in pursuing meaningful objectives.

[Essential Nature]
The fundamental characteristic of this quality is the alignment of recognition and response - the ability to act promptly when opportunity or obligation presents itself. Unlike mere speed or impulsiveness, it represents a cultivated readiness that combines clear perception with energetic engagement. This quality bridges the gap between intention and action, transforming understanding into lived experience through immediate, sustained engagement.

This encompasses both the initial spark of motivated action and the sustained energy that carries intention through to completion. It operates as a catalyst, converting potential into kinetic energy in human experience and development.

[Manifestations]
- Prompt response to recognized opportunities or obligations
- Sustained engagement with tasks despite resistance
- Natural momentum in daily activities and responsibilities
- Enthusiasm that energizes rather than depletes
- Consistent follow-through from intention to completion
- Ability to mobilize energy when needed
- Integration of insight and action

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay between awareness and energy, creating a state of ready responsiveness that precedes conscious deliberation. It functions by reducing the friction between recognition and action, eliminating the delays and hesitations that often interrupt purposeful activity. The quality develops through conscious practice in small matters, gradually building into an integrated disposition of energetic engagement.

In practical terms, it manifests as the capacity to begin promptly, maintain momentum, and complete effectively. This creates a virtuous cycle where successful engagement generates further energy and enthusiasm. Rather than depleting resources, this quality actually generates vitality through active engagement, leading to increased capacity for sustained, meaningful action across all areas of life.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: Yes - describes universal human experience of engagement vs inertia
2. Depth preservation: Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding of energy/action relationship
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear manifestations and development path
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - links personal experience to universal patterns
5. Development clarity: Yes - shows progression from conscious practice to integrated disposition
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - all listed expressions are concrete and verifiable

The description maintains the essence of zerizut while making it accessible and relevant to contemporary experience across cultural contexts. It preserves the sophisticated understanding of human motivation and action from the Mussar tradition while expressing it in universal terms.
