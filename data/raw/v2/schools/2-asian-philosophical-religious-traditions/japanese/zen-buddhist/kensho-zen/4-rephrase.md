Let me first analyze Kenshō through this framework before composing the output.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Direct experiential insight into reality's nature
Key functions:
- Breakthrough in understanding
- Dissolution of conceptual barriers
- Integration of subject/object
- Revelation of fundamental truth

Relationship patterns:
- Transforms perception
- Shifts basis of action
- Reorients relationship to experience
- Restructures understanding

Developmental aspects:
- Initial glimpse → deepening → integration
- Sudden insight → gradual embodiment
- Theory → experience → realization

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Moments of profound clarity
- Dissolution of mental barriers
- Direct knowing beyond concepts
- Fundamental shifts in perspective

Contemporary relevance:
- Psychological breakthrough moments
- Paradigm shifts in understanding
- Experiential learning
- Transformative insight

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Direct experiential insight that transcends conceptual understanding, revealing the fundamental nature of reality and self. This breakthrough in perception dissolves the usual boundaries between knower and known, leading to a radical shift in how experience itself is understood and navigated.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the human capacity for direct, unmediated understanding that operates beyond the usual mechanisms of conceptual thought and accumulated knowledge. It manifests as a fundamental shift in perspective that transforms the basic relationship between consciousness and experience. Unlike gradual learning or intellectual comprehension, it's a immediate recognition that simultaneously reveals both the nature of awareness itself and the essential character of what is being observed.

This recognition operates at a level prior to the usual subject-object split, revealing a more fundamental dimension of experience that's typically overlooked in ordinary consciousness. While often sudden in its initial appearance, it initiates a progressive transformation in how reality is perceived and understood.

[Manifestations]
- Sudden dissolution of persistent conceptual barriers or long-standing questions
- Direct recognition of the interdependent nature of experience and experiencer
- Spontaneous shift in the basic framework through which reality is understood
- Natural emergence of appropriate action without conceptual mediation
- Fundamental reorganization of one's relationship to experience
- Progressive integration of insight into daily functioning
- Increased capacity for direct understanding in new situations

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by temporarily or permanently suspending the usual conceptual frameworks through which experience is filtered, allowing direct contact with reality prior to mental categorization. It functions through immediate recognition rather than gradual accumulation, though its implications unfold over time. The initial breakthrough creates a reference point that progressively influences all aspects of perception and understanding.

In practical terms, this manifests as increased clarity in perception, reduced conceptual overlay in understanding, and more spontaneous appropriate action. It leads to greater effectiveness in navigating complex situations, as response emerges directly from clear seeing rather than through conceptual processing. This creates a more immediate and accurate engagement with reality, reducing the gap between understanding and action.

This universalized description aims to:
1. Preserve the transformative depth of kenshō
2. Make it accessible without Buddhist terminology
3. Connect it to universal human experience
4. Maintain its practical relevance
5. Capture both immediate and developmental aspects
6. Link individual experience to universal principles

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this description to better meet the objectives?
