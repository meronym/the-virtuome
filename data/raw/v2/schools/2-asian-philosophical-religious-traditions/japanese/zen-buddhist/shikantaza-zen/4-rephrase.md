Let me first analyze Shikantaza following our preparation framework:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Total presence without manipulation
Functions: 
- Sustained attention
- Non-discriminating awareness
- Direct experience
- Integration of being and doing
Systemic role: 
- Foundation for authentic presence
- Transcendence of subject-object duality
Development: From effortful to natural presence

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Moments of complete absorption
- Natural flow states
- Direct perception
- Undivided attention
Parallel concepts:
- Flow (psychology)
- Pure presence
- Uncontrived awareness
- Complete engagement

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Essence: Undivided presence
- Manifestation: Complete engagement
- Development: From intentional to natural
- Relations: Foundation for authentic action

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for complete, uncontrived presence in experience, characterized by undivided attention and total engagement without manipulation or goal-seeking. This quality manifests as a natural state of being fully present and engaged, transcending the usual separation between observer and observed.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the fundamental human capacity for direct, unmediated experience of reality. It emerges when conceptual overlays and goal-oriented striving naturally settle, revealing a state of pristine awareness that is simultaneously relaxed and fully engaged. Unlike ordinary attention, which segments experience into subject and object, this quality embodies a unified field of awareness where doing and being, attention and action, merge into seamless presence.

[Manifestations]
- Natural, sustained attention without effort or strain
- Seamless integration of awareness and activity
- Absence of self-conscious monitoring or adjustment
- Direct, immediate experience unclouded by concepts
- Profound settledness combined with complete engagement
- Spontaneous responsiveness without premeditation
- Dissolution of the usual boundary between self and activity

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through the natural settling of discriminating mind, allowing a more fundamental mode of awareness to emerge. Rather than being constructed or achieved, it manifests when the usual processes of seeking, adjusting, and controlling are allowed to settle naturally. This settling reveals an inherent capacity for direct, unified experience that typically remains obscured by our usual goal-oriented consciousness.

In practical expression, this quality transforms all activity through radical simplicity and completeness. Whether in complex tasks or simple actions, it manifests as natural, unforced engagement where nothing is added or subtracted from direct experience. This brings extraordinary effectiveness and authenticity to action, while simultaneously dissolving the usual sense of effort and achievement-seeking that characterizes ordinary activity.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the core insight of Shikantaza
2. Makes it accessible without Buddhist terminology
3. Maintains practical applicability
4. Links individual experience to universal capacity
5. Shows clear developmental trajectory
6. Provides observable manifestations
7. Retains philosophical sophistication
8. Connects to contemporary understanding
9. Maintains practical relevance
10. Ensures cross-cultural accessibility

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet our objectives?
