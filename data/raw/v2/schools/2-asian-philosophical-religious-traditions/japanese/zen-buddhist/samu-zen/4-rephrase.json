      "content": "Let me think through this systematically:\n\nANALYTICAL APPROACH:\n1. First, I need to consider what makes Zen Buddhism distinct, particularly in its Japanese manifestation\n2. Then, identify which virtues are truly central rather than peripheral\n3. Consider how these virtues interact and support each other\n4. Evaluate which combinations best capture the essence of Zen practice and realization\n\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS:\n\n1. Zen's Distinctive Character:\n- Emphasis on direct experience over theoretical understanding\n- Integration of practice and everyday life\n- Balance of discipline and spontaneity\n- Non-dual approach to virtue development\n- Embodied rather than purely mental practice\n\n2. Core Principles:\n- Practice is enlightenment (\u4fee\u8a3c\u4e00\u5982 shush\u014d-itt\u014d)\n- Direct pointing to the mind (\u76f4\u6307\u4eba\u5fc3 jikishi ninshin)\n- Seeing one's true nature (\u898b\u6027 kensh\u014d)\n- Everyday mind is the Way (\u5e73\u5e38\u5fc3\u662f\u9053 by\u014dj\u014dshin kore d\u014d)\n\n3. Practice Context:\n- Meditation as foundational\n- Community practice\n- Master-disciple relationship\n- Daily life activities as practice\n- Artistic expressions\n\n4. Development Pattern:\n- Initial discipline \u2192 Natural expression\n- Form \u2192 Formlessness\n- Effort \u2192 Effortlessness\n- Personal \u2192 Universal\n- Conventional \u2192 Ultimate\n\nBased on this analysis, I would propose the following shortlist as most representative:\n\n1. Mushin (\u7121\u5fc3) - No-mind\n- Fundamental state of unconditioned awareness\n- Transcends dualistic thinking\n- Base for spontaneous appropriate action\n\n2. Shikantaza (\u53ea\u7ba1\u6253\u5750) - Just sitting\n- Pure presence\n- Complete engagement\n- Beyond goal-oriented practice\n\n3. Fud\u014dshin (\u4e0d\u52d5\u5fc3) - Immovable mind\n- Unshakeable stability\n- Mental-emotional equilibrium\n- Groundedness in practice\n\n4. Gy\u014dji (\u884c\u6301) - Continuous practice\n- Sustained dedication\n- Integration of practice and daily life\n- Moment-to-moment awareness\n\n5. Zuijun (\u968f\u9806) - Harmonious following\n- Natural accordance with circumstances\n- Responsive adaptation\n- Freedom within form\n\n6. Kensh\u014d (\u898b\u6027) - Seeing true nature\n- Direct insight\n- Experiential wisdom\n- Beyond conceptual understanding\n\n7. Samu (\u4f5c\u52d9) - Mindful work\n- Practice in action\n- Attention to detail\n- Sacred ordinary\n\n8. Zanshin (\u6b8b\u5fc3) - Continued awareness\n- Sustained attention\n- Present-moment consciousness\n- Complete follow-through\n\nThese eight virtues form an interconnected system that:\n- Covers both meditative and active aspects\n- Includes both foundational and advanced qualities\n- Represents both practice and realization\n- Encompasses both individual and relational dimensions\n- Bridges conventional and ultimate perspectives\n\nThey progress from basic practice qualities to more subtle realizations, while maintaining the essential Zen characteristic of being simultaneously practice and goal.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these eight virtues? Or would you prefer to adjust this selection first?"

Initial Concept Analysis\n- Identify the virtue's core principle/phenomenon\n- List key functions and manifestations\n- Note relationship patterns and systemic roles\n- Map developmental aspects\n\n2. Universalization Process\n- Identify universal human experiences it relates to\n- Find parallel concepts across contexts\n- Note contemporary relevance/applications\n- Identify timeless patterns/principles\n\n3. Structural Analysis\nPrimary Elements:\n- Essential nature/core function\n- Observable manifestations\n- Developmental trajectory\n- Systemic relationships\n\nSecondary Elements:\n- Common obstacles/challenges\n- Supporting conditions\n- Related qualities\n- Practical applications\n\nCOMPOSITION GUIDELINES:\n1. Language:\n- Use phenomenological rather than theoretical language\n- Prefer experiential descriptions over abstract concepts\n- Balance precision with accessibility\n- Avoid culture-specific references\n\n2. Structure:\n- Start with clearest, most fundamental aspect\n- Build complexity progressively\n- Connect abstract principles to concrete manifestations\n- Link individual to universal aspects\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```markdown\n[Core Definition]\nSingle paragraph capturing fundamental essence\n(50-75 words)\n\n[Essential Nature]\nDeeper elaboration of the quality's nature and function\n(100-150 words)\n\n[Manifestations]\n- Observable expressions (4-7 bullet points)\n- Developmental aspects\n- Practical implementations\n- Relationship patterns\n\n[Functional Description]\nHow this quality operates and develops in human experience\nTwo paragraphs:\n1. Operation/mechanism (75-100 words)\n2. Practical expression/impact (75-100 words)\n```\n\nQUALITY CRITERIA:\n1. Comprehensiveness:\n- Captures full depth of original concept\n- Addresses multiple dimensions (personal/interpersonal/universal)\n- Includes both theoretical and practical aspects\n\n2. Accessibility:\n- Understandable without specialized knowledge\n- Relatable to common experience\n- Practical and applicable\n\n3. Precision:\n- Clear differentiation from related concepts\n- Specific rather than vague descriptions\n- Accurate to original meaning\n\n4. Relevance:\n- Contemporary applications clear\n- Universal human significance evident\n- Practical value apparent\n\nVERIFICATION QUESTIONS:\n1. Would this description be meaningful across cultures?\n2. Does it preserve the depth of the original concept?\n3. Is it practically applicable?\n4. Does it connect individual to universal aspects?\n5. Is it clear how this quality develops?\n6. Are the manifestations observable/verifiable?\n\nUPDATED SCOPE: Please focus on the following virtue: Samu. Follow the provided preparation instructions, composition guidelines, and output format to create a universal language description of the virtue."
