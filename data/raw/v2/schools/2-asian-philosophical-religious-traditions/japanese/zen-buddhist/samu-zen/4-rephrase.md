Let me follow the analytical process step by step:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Mindful engagement with practical activity
Functions: Integration of awareness with action, sanctification of ordinary tasks
Systemic role: Bridges contemplative and active aspects of practice
Developmental: Progresses from deliberate attention to natural presence

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Work/task engagement
- Focus/attention quality
- Action refinement
- Purpose in ordinary tasks

Parallel concepts:
- Flow states
- Mindful action
- Skilled attention
- Sacred activity

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to bring complete attention and presence to practical activities, transforming ordinary tasks into opportunities for deeper awareness and development. This quality manifests as refined action, precise attention, and the ability to maintain meditative awareness within daily activities.

[Essential Nature]
At its core, this quality represents the integration of contemplative awareness with practical action. It dissolves the artificial boundary between "spiritual" and "mundane" activities by bringing the same quality of presence to all tasks, whether seemingly significant or ordinary. This integration manifests as a natural dignity in action, precise attention to detail, and an attitude that recognizes the sacred potential in everyday work.

The development of this quality transforms both the doer and the task, leading to increased efficiency, reduced internal friction, and a deepening appreciation for the inherent value of all activity. It cultivates a form of embodied wisdom that manifests through refined action rather than abstract understanding.

[Manifestations]
- Precise, economical movement in physical tasks
- Sustained, relaxed attention to detail
- Natural dignity in ordinary activities
- Seamless integration of awareness and action
- Appreciation for the inherent value of all work
- Reduced self-consciousness in activity
- Observable refinement in task execution

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by unifying divided aspects of experience - mind and body, spiritual and practical, self and activity. Through sustained attention to physical tasks, it develops a form of embodied wisdom that manifests as natural precision and appropriate action. The regular exercise of this quality gradually dissolves the perceived barrier between formal practice and daily life, leading to a more integrated and authentic way of being.

In practical terms, this quality enhances both the effectiveness of action and the depth of personal development. Tasks performed with this quality show greater precision and efficiency while simultaneously serving as opportunities for growth. This dual function makes it particularly valuable in contemporary contexts where time for formal practice may be limited, as it transforms necessary daily activities into opportunities for development.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural? Yes - focuses on universal human activities and attention
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains contemplative aspect while emphasizing practical application
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear connection to daily activities
4. Individual/Universal? Yes - connects personal practice to universal principles
5. Development clear? Yes - describes progression from deliberate to natural
6. Observable? Yes - provides concrete behavioral markers

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
