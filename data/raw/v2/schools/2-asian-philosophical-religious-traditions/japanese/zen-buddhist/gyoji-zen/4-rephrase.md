Let me work through this systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Sustained engagement in practice
Functions: Integration, continuity, dedication, momentum
Systemic role: Foundational to development, bridges formal/informal practice
Development: From deliberate effort to natural flow

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Building lasting habits
- Maintaining long-term commitment
- Integration of principles into daily life
- Sustained focus and dedication

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary elements:
- Continuous engagement
- Integration of practice and life
- Sustained attention
- Progressive development

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Sustained engagement represents the capacity to maintain consistent, wholehearted involvement in meaningful practice across all life circumstances. It transforms isolated moments of practice into a continuous flow of dedicated attention, gradually integrating profound principles into every aspect of daily experience.

[Essential Nature]
Sustained engagement operates as a fundamental bridge between isolated moments of practice and comprehensive life transformation. It transcends the conventional distinction between "practice time" and "regular life," creating instead a seamless continuum of engaged presence. This quality combines careful attention with natural flow, deliberate cultivation with spontaneous expression, and focused discipline with effortless continuation.

Rather than representing mere persistence or repetition, it embodies the progressive integration of practice principles into every dimension of experience, allowing deeper understanding to emerge through consistent, wholehearted engagement with each moment's activities.

[Manifestations]
- Maintaining practice consistency through changing circumstances
- Natural integration of practice principles into daily activities
- Fluid transition between different forms of engagement
- Progressive deepening of understanding through sustained attention
- Emergence of spontaneous wisdom from continued practice
- Development of effortless presence in all activities
- Transformation of ordinary actions into opportunities for growth

[Functional Description]
Sustained engagement develops through an initial period of deliberate, conscious effort that gradually transforms into natural, spontaneous expression. This process begins with structured practice periods and expands to encompass increasingly diverse situations and activities. The practitioner learns to maintain continuity of awareness and engagement while adapting to changing circumstances, allowing deeper insights to emerge through persistent, wholehearted participation in each moment.

In practical terms, this quality manifests as an ability to maintain practice momentum regardless of external conditions or internal states. It enables the practitioner to transform everyday activities into opportunities for development, while simultaneously deepening formal practice through consistent engagement. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where practice enhances daily life, and daily life becomes an extension of practice, leading to increasingly natural and comprehensive integration.
