Let me follow the systematic process to universalize Makoto:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
- Core principle: Integration of inner truth with outer expression
- Key functions: Authenticity verification, trust-building, integrity maintenance
- Systemic role: Foundational quality enabling genuine relationships and social trust
- Developmental aspects: Progresses from external conformity to internal alignment

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
- Universal experiences: Truth-telling, promise-keeping, internal conflicts between appearance and reality
- Parallel concepts: Authenticity (Western), Ikhlas (Islamic), Sat (Hindu)
- Contemporary applications: Professional integrity, authentic leadership, genuine relationships
- Timeless patterns: Integration of thought/word/deed, development of trustworthiness

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The dynamic alignment of inner truth with outer expression, manifesting as complete congruence between thought, word, and action. This fundamental quality of human authenticity enables genuine relationships, sustainable trust, and integral character development through consistent unity of being.

[Essential Nature]
Authenticity-integrity represents the achievement of seamless continuity between internal reality and external expression. Unlike mere honesty or truthfulness, it encompasses the entire spectrum of human expression - thoughts, emotions, words, and actions - unified into a coherent whole. This quality develops through progressive integration of conscious intention with natural expression, ultimately manifesting as effortless truthfulness that requires no deliberation.

This state of being transcends simple truthfulness by eliminating the very possibility of deception, as inner and outer aspects become perfectly aligned. It serves as both a developmental process and an achieved state, marking the maturation of human character toward natural integrity.

[Manifestations]
- Effortless alignment between private thoughts and public actions
- Natural consistency in behavior across all contexts and relationships
- Spontaneous truthfulness without calculation or deliberation
- Deep resonance between emotional experience and expression
- Progressive integration of conscious values with instinctive responses
- Development from intentional truthfulness to natural integrity
- Manifestation of trustworthiness that others can intuitively sense

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous process of internal alignment and external verification. Initial development requires conscious attention to discrepancies between inner states and outer expressions, gradually eliminating gaps through persistent self-observation and correction. As integration deepens, the effort of maintaining consistency diminishes, replaced by natural congruence that functions automatically across all life dimensions.

In practical expression, this quality transforms relationships and social interactions by establishing unshakeable foundations of trust. Others naturally sense and respond to the presence of genuine integrity, creating environments of psychological safety and authentic connection. This enables deeper relationships, more effective collaboration, and sustained community trust, while simultaneously supporting the individual's ongoing character development through positive feedback between internal growth and external manifestation.

This universalized description aims to:
1. Preserve the sophisticated understanding of integrity-authenticity from the Japanese tradition
2. Make it accessible through universal human experiences
3. Maintain practical relevance across cultural contexts
4. Connect individual development with social impact
5. Describe observable manifestations and development patterns
6. Retain the depth of the original concept while removing culture-specific references

The description passes the verification questions by:
1. Using universally recognizable phenomena and experiences
2. Maintaining the sophisticated understanding of integrity development
3. Providing clear practical applications
4. Linking personal development to universal human potential
5. Outlining clear developmental progression
6. Describing observable manifestations in behavior and relationships

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the objectives?
