Here's the universalized description following the requested format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The intentional, systematic development of human excellence through integrated practice of awareness, understanding, and action. It represents the fundamental process through which a person progressively refines their character, capabilities, and conduct through conscious effort and regular practice.

[Essential Nature]
Self-cultivation is the meta-practice through which human potential actualizes into lived reality. It operates as both a foundation and framework for development, integrating intellectual understanding, emotional intelligence, and practical wisdom. This process works through the continuous interplay between learning, reflection, and application, creating a dynamic spiral of growth where theory informs practice and practice deepens understanding.

Unlike spontaneous growth or passive learning, it represents the conscious participation in one's own development, requiring sustained attention, systematic effort, and regular refinement of both understanding and action.

[Manifestations]
- Regular self-reflection and honest self-assessment
- Systematic study combined with practical application
- Progressive refinement of conduct and character
- Integration of knowledge into natural behavior
- Development of discernment and practical wisdom
- Increasing alignment of intention, understanding, and action
- Growth in capacity to positively influence others

[Functional Description]
The process operates through three interrelated mechanisms: structured practice that builds foundational capabilities, reflective examination that deepens understanding, and integrated application that tests and refines both. This creates a developmental cycle where each element strengthens the others, gradually transforming mechanical practice into embodied wisdom. The process requires both disciplined effort and receptive awareness, combining active cultivation with organic unfolding.

In practical terms, self-cultivation manifests as a sustained commitment to growth through daily practices, regular self-examination, and continuous refinement of action. It begins with basic disciplines but progressively develops into more subtle and comprehensive forms of mastery. Success becomes visible through increasing naturalness of virtue, growing effectiveness in action, and positive influence on others, while maintaining humble recognition of ongoing development needs.

This universalized description aims to:
- Preserve the depth of the original Japanese Neo-Confucian concept
- Make it accessible to contemporary practitioners
- Maintain its systematic nature while emphasizing practical application
- Connect individual practice to universal human development
- Highlight both intentional effort and organic growth aspects
- Show clear developmental progression
- Retain sophistication while using phenomenological language

The description should resonate across cultures while maintaining the rigor and depth of the original concept. It emphasizes observable manifestations and practical application while preserving the philosophical sophistication of the tradition.
