Let me work through this systematically for Gaku (学).

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core phenomenon: Active engagement in growth through structured learning
Key functions: 
- Knowledge acquisition
- Character development
- Skill mastery
- Understanding deepening
- Wisdom cultivation

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Common human experiences:
- Natural curiosity
- Progressive skill development
- Knowledge integration
- Understanding expansion
- Personal transformation through learning

Here's the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The active disposition toward growth through systematic learning, characterized by dedicated engagement with knowledge, experience, and understanding. It manifests as the sustained cultivation of wisdom through both structured study and lived experience, integrating intellectual development with character formation and practical mastery.

[Essential Nature]
Learning as a virtue represents the human capacity for intentional development through systematic engagement with knowledge and experience. It transcends mere information acquisition, embodying instead a fundamental orientation toward growth that integrates understanding, character, and capability. This quality combines intellectual rigor with personal transformation, expressing itself through sustained dedication to improvement and the progressive refinement of both knowledge and being.

At its core, it represents the conscious participation in human development through disciplined engagement with wisdom in all its forms - theoretical, practical, and moral. This encompasses both formal study and experiential learning, united by the thread of intentional cultivation.

[Manifestations]
- Sustained dedication to understanding through systematic study
- Regular engagement with sources of knowledge and wisdom
- Integration of theoretical learning with practical application
- Progressive development of expertise in chosen domains
- Active seeking of feedback and correction
- Cultivation of deeper understanding through reflection
- Application of learned principles to new situations

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through the interplay of structured engagement and organic integration. It begins with conscious attention to sources of knowledge or skill, progresses through systematic study or practice, and develops through the progressive integration of new understanding with existing knowledge. The process is characterized by active engagement rather than passive reception, with each stage of learning building upon and transforming previous understanding.

In practical terms, it manifests as regular dedicated study, systematic skill practice, active seeking of understanding, and conscious integration of learning into life. This includes formal education, self-directed study, experiential learning, and the development of expertise through sustained practice. Success is measured not just in knowledge acquired but in the transformation of understanding, capability, and character through the learning process.

This universalization maintains the core aspects of Gaku while making them accessible across cultural contexts:

PRESERVATION OF KEY ELEMENTS:
1. Integration of moral and practical learning
2. Systematic nature of true learning
3. Transformation through study
4. Active rather than passive nature
5. Connection to character development

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: ✓ (focuses on universal human capacity for growth)
2. Depth preservation: ✓ (maintains transformative aspect)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear manifestations and development path)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (links personal growth to universal human development)
5. Development clarity: ✓ (progressive nature clearly described)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (concrete, verifiable expressions included)

This reformulation aims to capture the essence of Gaku while making it accessible and applicable across cultural contexts, maintaining both its practical and transformative aspects.
