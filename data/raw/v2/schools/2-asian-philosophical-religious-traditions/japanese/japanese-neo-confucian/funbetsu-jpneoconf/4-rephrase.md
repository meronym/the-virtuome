Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF FUNBETSU:
- Core principle: Practical moral wisdom expressed through situational judgment
- Key functions: Discernment, appropriate response, contextual awareness
- Systemic role: Bridges theoretical understanding and practical action
- Developmental aspects: Progresses from rule-following to intuitive wisdom

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Common human experiences:
- Decision-making in complex situations
- Navigating social nuances
- Balancing competing obligations
- Timing and appropriateness
- Practical wisdom development

Universal patterns:
- Progressive refinement of judgment
- Integration of knowledge and experience
- Development of social intelligence
- Cultivation of practical wisdom

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to discern and execute appropriate action through refined judgment that integrates moral understanding, practical wisdom, and situational awareness. It represents the mature ability to navigate complex situations while maintaining alignment with deeper principles and practical requirements.

[Essential Nature]
Practical wisdom manifested as refined judgment represents the integration of theoretical understanding with experiential knowledge, enabling appropriate response to complex situations. It operates as an active discernment that goes beyond mere rule-following to grasp the essential nature of circumstances and determine fitting action. This quality combines keen observation, pattern recognition, and moral sensitivity with an understanding of practical constraints and opportunities.

This form of wisdom particularly shines in situations where general principles must be applied to specific circumstances, or when multiple valid considerations must be balanced. It represents the bridge between knowing what is right in theory and determining what is appropriate in practice.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent demonstration of good judgment in complex situations
- Ability to recognize and respond to subtle contextual factors
- Natural grasp of appropriate timing and approach
- Balanced consideration of multiple perspectives and needs
- Integration of moral principles with practical requirements
- Capacity to anticipate consequences and implications
- Development of increasingly refined intuitive understanding

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive integration of theoretical understanding with practical experience, moving from conscious rule-application to intuitive wisdom. It begins with careful study and observation, advances through reflective experience, and matures into refined judgment that can grasp the essence of situations directly. The development process requires both active engagement with varied circumstances and regular reflection on outcomes and patterns.

In practice, this wisdom manifests as the ability to navigate complex situations with appropriate response, neither over-simplifying nor over-complicating. It enables one to maintain alignment with deeper principles while adapting to specific contexts, finding solutions that honor both practical constraints and higher values. This capacity becomes particularly valuable in leadership, professional practice, and any situation requiring balanced judgment.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: ✓ (focuses on universal human experience of developing practical wisdom)
2. Preservation of depth: ✓ (maintains sophisticated understanding of judgment development)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear connection to real-world situations)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (links personal development to universal patterns)
5. Development clarity: ✓ (clear progression from basic to refined judgment)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (concrete, verifiable expressions)

The description maintains the sophistication of the original Japanese Neo-Confucian concept while making it accessible and relevant to contemporary contexts. It preserves the essential integration of moral and practical wisdom while expressing it in universal terms.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
