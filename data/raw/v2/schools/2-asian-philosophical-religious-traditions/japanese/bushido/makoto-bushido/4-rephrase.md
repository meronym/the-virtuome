Let me follow the process systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Authentic alignment of inner truth with outer expression
Key functions:
- Unifies thought, word, and action
- Validates other virtues through authenticity
- Creates trustworthiness through consistency
- Enables genuine human connection

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Struggle between authenticity and social pressure
- Desire for genuine self-expression
- Need for internal coherence
- Search for meaningful relationships

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Wholeness of character
- Integration of being and action
- Progressive self-actualization
- Resonance between internal and external

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of complete authenticity where inner truth and outer expression become one, manifesting as a natural alignment between thought, word, and action. It represents the integration of being and doing, where genuine character flows naturally into consistent behavior and transparent relationships.

[Essential Nature]
Authentic wholeness emerges when artificial barriers between inner and outer experience dissolve, revealing a natural state of integrated being. This quality manifests as a profound congruence between what one understands, feels, says, and does. It transcends mere honesty or truthfulness, pointing to a fundamental unity of character where pretense falls away and genuine nature expresses itself directly.

This integration creates a crystalline clarity in human relationships and actions, where trust arises naturally from consistency, and wisdom manifests through spontaneous appropriate response rather than calculated behavior.

[Manifestations]
- Natural congruence between internal understanding and external expression
- Spontaneous appropriate response without calculation or pretense
- Consistent behavior flowing from stable character rather than rules
- Transparent and trust-generating presence in relationships
- Progressive refinement of self-understanding through honest self-reflection
- Capacity to maintain authenticity under social pressure
- Direct and clear communication arising from internal clarity

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive alignment of scattered aspects of self into a coherent whole. Initial practice often involves conscious effort to maintain consistency between thought and action, gradually evolving into natural spontaneity as integration deepens. The process requires continuous honest self-reflection and the courage to remain true to one's understanding despite external pressures.

In practical expression, this quality creates trustworthy leadership, genuine relationships, and effective action. It manifests as natural authority that comes from character rather than position, clear communication that resolves confusion, and decisive action that springs from deep understanding rather than mere reaction. People with this quality tend to create zones of clarity and trust around them, where others feel safe to be genuine themselves.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the depth of makoto's integration of being and action
2. Makes it accessible through universal human experiences
3. Maintains practical relevance for contemporary contexts
4. Retains the sophisticated understanding of character development
5. Connects individual practice to universal principles
6. Provides observable manifestations while preserving subtle aspects

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: ✓ (focuses on universal human experiences)
2. Depth preservation: ✓ (maintains sophisticated understanding of integration)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear manifestations and development path)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (links personal practice to universal principles)
5. Development clarity: ✓ (shows progression from effort to spontaneity)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (concrete behavioral indicators provided)
