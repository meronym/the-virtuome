Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Rei (礼):
Core principle: Harmonious alignment of inner state and outer form
Key functions: Social harmony, self-cultivation, respect expression
Systemic role: Bridges internal virtue and external behavior
Developmental aspects: From formal rules to natural embodiment

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Need for social coordination
- Expression of respect
- Cultivation of mindful presence
- Development of social wisdom
- Embodied awareness

Parallel concepts:
- Social intelligence
- Embodied mindfulness
- Ceremonial awareness
- Cultural competence
- Interpersonal harmony

Here's my attempt at a universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The cultivated capacity to embody appropriate form and presence in any situation, where inner awareness and outer expression align to create harmony and mutual dignity in human interactions. This quality manifests as refined conduct that naturally responds to and elevates each moment's unique requirements.

[Essential Nature]
At its heart, this quality represents the sophisticated integration of awareness, respect, and appropriate action. It goes beyond mere etiquette or rules of behavior to encompass a deeper understanding of human dignity and social harmony. It is the bridge between internal cultivation and external expression, where proper form becomes a natural manifestation of developed character rather than merely learned behavior.

This quality emerges from the recognition that human interactions have both practical and symbolic dimensions, and that mindful attention to form can create spaces of mutual dignity and understanding. It reflects the mature capacity to read situations deeply and respond with actions that honor both universal principles and particular contexts.

[Manifestations]
- Natural grace in navigating social situations without self-consciousness
- Intuitive understanding of what each moment requires
- Ability to create atmosphere of mutual dignity through presence and conduct
- Balanced attention to both formal requirements and human needs
- Elevation of routine interactions into moments of meaning
- Embodied expression of respect that makes others feel valued
- Capacity to maintain proper form even in challenging situations

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through the continuous refinement of awareness and conduct, where external forms are internalized until they become natural expressions of character. It develops through deliberate practice of appropriate forms combined with deepening understanding of human nature and social dynamics. The initial stage of conscious learning gradually transforms into embodied wisdom that can spontaneously manifest the right action for each situation.

In practical application, it enables one to navigate complex social situations with grace, maintain dignity under pressure, and create harmonious interactions that elevate all participants. It manifests as the capacity to read social contexts accurately, respond appropriately to subtle cues, and maintain proper form while remaining authentically present. This quality turns potentially mundane interactions into opportunities for mutual growth and understanding, while preserving essential human dignity in all exchanges.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: ✓ (focuses on universal human experiences)
2. Depth preservation: ✓ (maintains sophisticated understanding while removing culture-specific elements)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear behavioral manifestations)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (links personal development to universal principles)
5. Developmental clarity: ✓ (shows progression from conscious practice to embodied wisdom)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (concrete, verifiable expressions)

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
