Let me work through this systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Meiyo (名誉):
Core principle: Personal dignity maintained through ethical conduct
Key functions: 
- Self-regulation mechanism
- Social integrity maintainer
- Value alignment guide
- Character development driver

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Need for self-respect
- Desire for integrity
- Internal/external congruence
- Reputation management
- Living up to principles

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Internal dignity compass
- External behavior guide
- Progressive self-development
- Social responsibility anchor

Secondary:
- Challenge: balancing internal/external
- Condition: clear principles
- Related: integrity, dignity, reputation
- Applications: professional/personal conduct

Here's the universalized description following the requested format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Personal dignity expressed through unwavering adherence to ethical principles and manifested in the alignment of internal character with external conduct. This quality represents the natural authority that emerges when one's actions consistently reflect deeply held values and commitments.

[Essential Nature]
Personal dignity is a self-sustaining quality that emerges from the consistent alignment of internal principles with external behavior. It manifests as a form of natural authority that doesn't demand recognition but naturally earns respect through demonstrated character. This quality serves as both an internal compass for decision-making and an external standard for conduct, creating a self-reinforcing cycle where maintaining one's principles strengthens one's character, which in turn makes maintaining principles easier.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent alignment between stated values and observable actions
- Calm self-possession in challenging situations
- Natural authority that draws respect without demanding it
- Reliable fulfillment of commitments regardless of convenience
- Maintenance of ethical standards even when unobserved
- Progressive refinement of character through conscious choice
- Balanced integration of personal conviction and social responsibility

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interaction between internal standards and external behavior, creating a self-reinforcing system of character development. When faced with choices, it acts as an internal reference point that automatically eliminates options that would compromise one's principles, while simultaneously providing the strength to follow through on difficult but correct choices. The quality grows stronger through each choice that maintains integrity, creating an increasingly stable foundation for future decisions.

In practical terms, this manifests as a natural authority that doesn't rely on position or power, but emerges from demonstrated character. It enables consistent ethical behavior without internal conflict, as maintaining one's principles becomes less a matter of conscious effort and more a natural expression of who one is. This creates a form of freedom through discipline, where doing what's right becomes the easiest choice because it's most aligned with one's nature.
```

This universalization:
1. Maintains the core meaning of Meiyo while making it accessible
2. Preserves the sophisticated internal/external dynamic
3. Connects individual character to universal principles
4. Provides clear markers for development
5. Offers practical applications
6. Retains the depth of the original concept

It addresses the verification questions by:
- Making the concept culturally universal
- Preserving the sophisticated dynamics of the original
- Providing clear practical applications
- Connecting personal to universal aspects
- Outlining development patterns
- Offering observable manifestations

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the objectives?
