Let me first analyze the concept following our preparation framework:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Balanced strength in facing challenges
Key functions:
- Enables facing difficulty/danger
- Supports moral conviction
- Facilitates right action under pressure
- Maintains integrity against opposition
Systemic role: Activating/enabling virtue that empowers other virtues
Developmental: Progresses from basic resolve to ethical wisdom

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Confronting fear
- Standing for principles
- Facing uncertainty
- Making difficult choices
- Overcoming internal resistance
Contemporary applications:
- Ethical leadership
- Personal integrity
- Social responsibility
- Crisis management
- Moral decision-making

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Wise strength in adversity
- Balance of action and restraint
- Integration of physical/moral courage
- Progressive development from basic to ethical courage

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain clear, wise action in the face of difficulty, danger, or opposition. It integrates physical resolve with moral conviction, enabling one to both act and refrain from action based on ethical understanding rather than mere fearlessness or impulse.

[Essential Nature]
Courage manifests as an internal clarity and strength that transforms challenging situations from threats into opportunities for right action. It operates through the integration of three elements: the physical capacity to act despite fear, the moral wisdom to discern right action, and the spiritual clarity to maintain perspective under pressure.

This quality transcends mere fearlessness or bravado, representing instead a mature capacity to respond to circumstances with both power and wisdom. It develops through progressive challenges that unite physical, moral, and spiritual aspects of human experience.

[Manifestations]
- Physical steadiness and calm presence during crisis or conflict
- Clear decision-making under pressure or opposition
- Standing firmly for principles despite personal cost
- Protecting others or important values despite risk
- Speaking truth to power with respect and wisdom
- Taking responsible action despite uncertainty
- Restraining action when wisdom indicates patience

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a progressive integration of physical, emotional, and ethical capacities. Initial development focuses on managing fear and building basic resolve. This foundation then expands to include moral discernment, leading to the ability to distinguish between situations requiring action or restraint. The mature expression integrates these aspects into a unified capacity for wise, powerful action.

In practical application, it manifests as a composed, clear presence in challenging situations. This presence enables both decisive action and measured restraint, guided by ethical understanding rather than reactive impulses. It supports leadership, protection of values, and ethical decision-making while maintaining internal peace and external effectiveness.
```

This universalization:
1. Maintains the depth of the original Japanese concept while making it accessible
2. Preserves the integration of physical and moral aspects
3. Emphasizes development/maturation of the quality
4. Links individual experience to universal human challenges
5. Provides clear, observable manifestations
6. Retains practical applicability across contexts

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universalization?
