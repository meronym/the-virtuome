Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF MAKOTO:
Core principle: Alignment of inner truth with outer expression
Key functions: 
- Authenticating human-divine relationships
- Grounding social trust
- Enabling genuine self-expression
- Facilitating spiritual connection

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Desire for authentic self-expression
- Need for trustworthy relationships
- Tension between social roles and inner truth
- Quest for genuine connection

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of complete authenticity where inner truth and outer expression become one unified reality. It manifests as consistency between thought, feeling, speech, and action, creating a state of transparent genuineness that enables deep connection with self, others, and the fundamental nature of reality.

[Essential Nature]
Authenticity in this sense goes beyond mere honesty or truthfulnessâ€”it represents a fundamental alignment of being where all layers of the self come into perfect coherence. This alignment creates a state of natural transparency where pretense falls away not through effort but through the simple power of undivided presence. It functions as both a way of being and a dynamic force that dissolves artificial boundaries between inner and outer experience.

This quality operates as a kind of existential clarity that serves as the foundation for genuine relationship, whether with oneself, others, nature, or the sacred dimension of life. It represents the natural state of human consciousness when unburdened by pretense, fear, or social conditioning.

[Manifestations]
- Speech that spontaneously reflects true thought and feeling without calculation
- Actions that flow naturally from genuine conviction rather than external pressure
- Relationships characterized by deep trust and transparent communication
- Decision-making that emerges from clear inner knowing rather than external rules
- Worship or spiritual practice that arises from genuine reverence rather than formal obligation
- Leadership that inspires through genuine embodiment rather than positioned authority

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive removal of internal divisions rather than through accumulation of virtuous behaviors. As artificial separations between different aspects of self dissolve, a natural integrity emerges. This process is supported by practices of self-reflection, courageous truth-telling, and willing vulnerability in trusted relationships. The development usually involves confronting fears of rejection and judgment that drive pretense and social masking.

In practical expression, this quality transforms relationships by creating conditions for genuine trust and understanding. It enables clear communication, authentic leadership, and meaningful connection with others and with one's deepest values. Rather than creating conflict with social harmony, true authenticity actually enhances it by replacing superficial agreement with genuine understanding and mutual respect. This quality serves as a foundation for both personal development and healthy community.

This universal translation aims to:
1. Preserve the profound spiritual depth of makoto
2. Make it accessible across cultural contexts
3. Maintain practical applicability
4. Connect individual practice to universal principles
5. Address both personal and interpersonal dimensions

The description emphasizes:
- Phenomenological experience over cultural specifics
- Universal human experiences and aspirations
- Practical manifestations and development
- Both individual and collective implications

Would you like me to adjust any aspect to better meet the objectives?
