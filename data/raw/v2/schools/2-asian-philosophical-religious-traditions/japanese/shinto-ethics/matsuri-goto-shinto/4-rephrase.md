Let me follow the analytical process and then create the universal description.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Integration of sacred/cosmic order with practical governance
Key functions: 
- Harmonizing spiritual and material dimensions of community life
- Organizing collective activities according to natural/divine principles
- Maintaining social order through sacred understanding
- Facilitating community cohesion through ritual structure

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Need for meaningful social organization
- Balance between structure and organic development
- Integration of higher principles with practical needs
- Community leadership and responsibility

Parallel concepts:
- Stewardship
- Sacred governance
- Holistic leadership
- Integrated community management

Here's the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to organize and guide collective human activities in harmony with deeper principles of natural and cosmic order, integrating practical governance with sacred understanding to create sustainable, meaningful community structures that serve both material and spiritual needs.

[Essential Nature]
Sacred stewardship represents the integration of higher principles with practical leadership, recognizing that genuine social order emerges from alignment with natural patterns and universal truths. This quality manifests as the ability to create and maintain organizational structures that honor both the practical needs of community life and the deeper patterns of existence.

It operates through careful attention to both visible and invisible dimensions of community life, recognizing that sustainable order emerges from understanding and working with, rather than against, the natural flow of human and cosmic relationships. This understanding informs all aspects of leadership and community organization.

[Manifestations]
- Thoughtful organization of community activities that serve both practical and spiritual needs
- Leadership decisions that consider both immediate circumstances and deeper principles
- Creation of meaningful rituals and procedures that structure collective life
- Careful stewardship of resources that recognizes their sacred as well as practical value
- Development of systems and structures that promote both efficiency and meaning
- Integration of traditional wisdom with contemporary needs

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive understanding of the interconnection between practical and sacred dimensions of community life. It begins with recognition of pattern and order in natural and human systems, deepens through practical experience in community organization, and matures into intuitive understanding of how to align human activities with universal principles. The development process requires both practical leadership experience and contemplative understanding.

In practice, this quality enables leaders and community members to create sustainable, meaningful organizational structures that serve both immediate needs and higher purposes. It manifests in the ability to make decisions that consider multiple dimensions of community life, to create procedures and systems that honor both efficiency and meaning, and to guide collective activities in ways that promote both material and spiritual well-being. This integration results in communities that are both practically effective and deeply meaningful to their members.

This universalization maintains the core insights of Matsuri-goto while making them accessible and relevant across cultural contexts. It preserves:

1. The integration of sacred and practical dimensions
2. The emphasis on natural/cosmic order
3. The focus on community well-being
4. The importance of meaningful structure
5. The dynamic between individual leadership and collective harmony

The description is:
- Phenomenological rather than theoretical
- Applicable across cultural contexts
- Practical while maintaining depth
- Connected to universal human experience
- Clear about development and manifestation

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
