Let me first analyze Kansha following the preparation framework before composing the universal description.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Deep appreciative awareness of life's interconnected nature
Key functions:
- Recognition of received benefits
- Awareness of dependencies
- Emotional resonance with support systems
- Motivation for reciprocal care
- Cultivation of humble receptivity

Relationship patterns:
- Individual → Community
- Human → Nature
- Present → Past/Future
- Receiver → Giver
- Part → Whole

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Common human experiences:
- Receiving help/support
- Recognizing interdependence
- Feeling supported by larger systems
- Experiencing abundance
- Acknowledging life's gifts

Parallel concepts:
- Gratitude (Western)
- Appreciation (Global)
- Recognition (Secular)
- Thankfulness (Religious)
- Reverence (Philosophical)

Here's the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The sustained recognition and felt appreciation of life's interconnected web of support, manifesting as deep awareness of received benefits and genuine emotional resonance with the sources of sustenance, leading to natural reciprocal care and humble participation in life's giving-receiving cycles.

[Essential Nature]
Deep appreciation emerges from clear recognition of how our existence is constantly supported by countless seen and unseen contributions - from nature's provisions to human kindness, from ancestral legacy to community support. This quality combines cognitive recognition with heart-felt resonance, creating a sustained awareness that shapes perception, emotion, and action.

This awareness naturally develops into an embodied sense of participating in life's flow of giving and receiving, fostering humble receptivity and spontaneous care for the sources of support. It represents a fundamental shift from self-centered to interconnected consciousness.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous recognition of benefits and support received
- Natural emotional warmth toward sources of sustenance
- Careful attention to and maintenance of supporting relationships
- Humble receptivity to life's gifts and provisions
- Active care and consideration for supporting systems
- Regular acknowledgment of dependencies and interconnections
- Conscious participation in cycles of giving and receiving

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through sustained attention to life's supporting conditions, developing from initial recognition of obvious benefits to progressively deeper awareness of subtle interconnections. It involves both cognitive understanding and emotional attunement, creating a comprehensive shift in how one perceives and relates to reality. This perceptual transformation naturally motivates careful stewardship and reciprocal care.

In practical expression, it manifests as regular acknowledgment of received benefits, careful attention to supporting relationships, and natural reciprocal care. It shapes daily behavior through increased consideration of impacts on supporting systems, conscious participation in giving-receiving cycles, and spontaneous expressions of appreciation. This creates a positive feedback loop where recognition deepens connection, which in turn enhances awareness and care.
```

This universalization:
1. Preserves the deep awareness central to Kansha
2. Makes it accessible across cultural contexts
3. Maintains practical applicability
4. Links individual experience to universal patterns
5. Outlines clear development path
6. Provides observable manifestations
7. Retains sophistication while using accessible language

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universal description?
