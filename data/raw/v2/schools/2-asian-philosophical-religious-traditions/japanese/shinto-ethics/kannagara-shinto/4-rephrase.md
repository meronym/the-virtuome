Let me follow the process systematically for Kannagara:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Alignment with natural/divine principles in daily life
Functions: Guidance, harmonization, natural wisdom, authentic living
Systemic role: Bridges individual conduct with universal patterns
Developmental: Progresses from conscious effort to natural flow

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Flow states
- Natural rhythm attunement
- Intuitive wisdom
- Environmental harmony
- Authentic resonance

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to align one's life with natural principles and universal patterns, manifesting as an intuitive ability to act in harmony with life's fundamental rhythms and wisdom. This quality enables effortless navigation of complexity through attunement to deeper patterns of reality.

[Essential Nature]
Represents the human capacity to recognize, resonate with, and embody fundamental patterns of life and reality. Unlike imposed rules or conscious calculation, it manifests as an intuitive knowing that emerges from deep attunement to natural processes and universal principles. This quality develops through careful observation, receptive awareness, and progressive alignment of personal action with recognized patterns of truth, beauty, and effectiveness in nature and human experience.

[Manifestations]
- Effortless timing in action and decision-making
- Natural authority emerging from pattern recognition
- Spontaneous wisdom in complex situations
- Harmonious relationship with environmental cycles
- Deep resonance between personal conduct and universal principles
- Progressive refinement of intuitive understanding
- Integration of individual action with collective well-being

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through progressive refinement of perception and response, developing from conscious observation to intuitive knowing. It begins with careful attention to natural patterns and cycles, gradually incorporating this understanding into automatic responses. Through sustained practice and awareness, one develops an increasingly refined ability to recognize and align with fundamental principles manifesting in each situation.

In practical expression, this quality enables navigation of complexity with remarkable effectiveness and minimal friction. It manifests as decisions and actions that naturally account for multiple factors and relationships, producing outcomes that benefit the whole system. This creates a characteristic grace and authority that emerges not from position or power, but from deep alignment with reality's inherent patterns.
