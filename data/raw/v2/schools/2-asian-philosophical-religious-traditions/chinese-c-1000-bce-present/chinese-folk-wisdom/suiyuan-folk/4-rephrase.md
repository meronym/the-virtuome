Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS (Suíyuán):
Core principle: Adaptive responsiveness within natural flow
Key functions: 
- Balancing acceptance and action
- Maintaining equilibrium during change
- Converting challenges into opportunities
- Harmonizing personal will with circumstances

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Encountering unexpected changes
- Navigating uncertainty
- Finding peace amid chaos
- Balancing control and surrender

Parallel concepts:
- Psychological resilience
- Ecological adaptation
- Flow states
- Strategic flexibility

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain inner harmony while skillfully adapting to changing circumstances, combining clear recognition of reality with appropriate responsive action. This quality enables fluid navigation of life's uncertainties while preserving one's center and purpose.

[Essential Nature]
At its heart, this quality represents the sophisticated balance between acceptance and agency. It manifests as the ability to accurately read situations, recognize natural trajectories and limitations, and respond with well-calibrated action that neither forces nor submits passively. Like water finding its path, it combines ultimate flexibility with quiet persistence.

This quality emerges from the deep understanding that life's flow contains both challenges and opportunities, and that sustainable progress comes through working with, rather than against, the natural unfolding of circumstances.

[Manifestations]
- Maintaining emotional equilibrium during unexpected changes
- Finding creative solutions within given constraints
- Adjusting plans smoothly when circumstances shift
- Converting apparent obstacles into stepping stones
- Knowing when to act and when to wait
- Preserving core purpose while adapting methods
- Reading and responding to situational dynamics effectively

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through continuous dynamic assessment of both internal and external conditions. It requires heightened awareness of contextual factors, clear recognition of real possibilities, and the wisdom to distinguish between what can be influenced and what must be accepted. The process involves constant micro-adjustments, like a skilled sailor working with changing winds.

In practice, this manifests as neither passive resignation nor forceful control, but as skillful navigation. It enables one to maintain progress toward meaningful goals while dancing with uncertainty and change. This approach consistently transforms potential adversity into opportunity, creating sustainable forward movement that conserves energy and maintains harmony.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the core wisdom of Suíyuán
2. Makes it accessible across cultures
3. Maintains practical applicability
4. Connects individual experience to universal patterns
5. Provides clear developmental pathway
6. Offers observable manifestations
7. Retains sophistication while using accessible language

The description achieves this by:
- Using natural metaphors (water, sailing) that are universally understood
- Focusing on common human experiences with change and uncertainty
- Emphasizing practical manifestations and benefits
- Maintaining the subtle sophistication of the original concept
- Connecting individual practice to universal principles

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the objectives?
