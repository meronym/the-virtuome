Let me break this down step by step.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Hòudào (厚道):

Core Principle:
- Substantive goodwill expressed through generous interpretation and treatment of others
- "Thickness" of moral consideration and response
- Going beyond surface-level obligations

Key Functions:
- Building sustainable trust
- Creating social resilience
- Facilitating genuine reciprocity
- Deepening relationships
- Preventing conflict escalation

Systemic Roles:
- Social fabric strengthening
- Community trust building
- Conflict prevention
- Relationship maintenance
- Resource circulation

Developmental Aspects:
- Starts with basic fairness
- Develops through intentional generosity
- Matures into habitual magnanimity
- Culminates in wisdom-guided benevolence

Here's my attempt at a universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to extend generous interpretation and treatment to others, characterized by a depth of consideration that goes beyond minimal obligations. It manifests as a reliable pattern of magnanimous responses that builds trust and strengthens social bonds through substantive goodwill.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the maturation of basic fairness into active generosity of spirit. It operates through a combination of wisdom and benevolence, where one consistently chooses to interpret and respond to situations with depth of consideration rather than superficial judgment. Unlike simple kindness, it carries an element of substantive engagement with others' circumstances and needs, coupled with the wisdom to respond appropriately rather than merely conventionally.

The "thickness" in this quality refers to both the depth of consideration and the substantiveness of response - it is neither superficial in understanding nor thin in execution. This creates a pattern of interaction that builds genuine trust and facilitates deeper relationships.

[Manifestations]
- Interpreting others' actions with generous assumption of good intent
- Responding to needs beyond explicit requests
- Maintaining equanimity in challenging interactions
- Offering substantial rather than token assistance
- Creating patterns of reliable support that others can count on
- Building trust through consistent demonstration of good faith
- Preventing conflicts through preemptive consideration

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by maintaining a consistent internal orientation of generous interpretation while expressing itself through substantive external actions. It develops through conscious practice of extending beyond minimal obligations, gradually building into a natural disposition of magnanimous response. The wisdom component guides appropriate boundaries, preventing both exploitation and enabling, while the benevolence component ensures genuine concern rather than mere calculation.

In practice, this quality creates a distinctive pattern of social interaction characterized by depth of engagement and reliability of support. It manifests in business as fair dealing beyond contract terms, in community as reliable mutual aid beyond formal obligations, and in relationships as consistent consideration beyond conventional expectations. This pattern generates social trust and resilience, creating sustainable networks of reciprocal support and understanding.

This universalization maintains the essential depth of hòudào while making it accessible across cultural contexts. It preserves the crucial distinction between surface-level kindness and substantive engagement that characterizes the original concept, while expressing it in terms of universal human experiences and relationships.

The description emphasizes observable manifestations and practical implementations while retaining the sophisticated understanding of how this quality develops and functions in human interaction. It connects individual practice to broader social impact, making clear both the personal developmental path and the systemic benefits.

Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect of this universalization?
