      "content": "Let me think about the key characteristics of Chinese Folk Wisdom that make it distinct and particularly relevant to virtue development:\n\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS:\n\n1.

INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION\n- Folk wisdom emphasizes the passing down of life lessons\n- Virtues are often taught through stories, proverbs, and lived examples\n- Strong focus on time-tested principles\n\n4. HOLISTIC INTEGRATION\n- Virtues are seen as interconnected rather than isolated\n- Balance and moderation are recurring themes\n- Recognition of the relationship between internal cultivation and external manifestation\n\n5. SURVIVAL AND PROSPERITY FOCUS\n- Many virtues relate to ensuring long-term stability and success\n- Strong practical emphasis on family and community survival\n- Balance between immediate needs and long-term sustainability\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA:\n1. Historical persistence and widespread recognition\n2. Practical applicability across different life contexts\n3. Representativeness of core Chinese folk values\n4.
