Let me analyze and transform Jīdé (积德) following the structured approach:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Cumulative moral development through intentional action
Key functions:
- Progressive character building
- Moral consequence awareness
- Intergenerational impact
- Social responsibility cultivation

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Personal growth through consistent choices
- Impact awareness of actions
- Legacy building
- Moral development through practice

STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Accumulative nature of character development
- Long-term perspective on moral growth
- Ripple effects of ethical choices
- Intentional virtue cultivation

Secondary:
- Short-term vs long-term tension
- Social impact awareness
- Developmental challenges
- Support systems

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The progressive accumulation of moral strength through consistent ethical choices and actions, recognizing that character development occurs through sustained intention and practice rather than singular decisions. This quality emphasizes the cumulative nature of personal growth and its ripple effects through social relationships and time.

[Essential Nature]
Character development functions as an accumulative process where each choice and action contributes to an evolving moral foundation. Like a river formed by countless droplets or a mountain built from countless grains, moral strength develops through persistent positive choices that compound over time. This process acknowledges both the immediate impact of actions and their long-term resonance through relationships, generations, and social structures.

The quality operates through conscious awareness of how present choices shape future character, combining immediate ethical awareness with long-term developmental perspective. It recognizes that moral growth requires both intentional cultivation and patient persistence, similar to how natural processes require both active tending and time to mature.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent small ethical choices in daily situations
- Awareness of how actions affect both self and others across time
- Patient investment in long-term character development
- Attention to the ripple effects of moral choices
- Recognition of how personal growth influences social circles
- Regular reflection on the accumulated impact of choices
- Active contribution to collective moral development

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through three primary mechanisms: awareness of moral opportunity in daily situations, recognition of the accumulative nature of choices, and understanding of how individual development affects collective wellbeing. It requires maintaining both immediate ethical awareness and long-term perspective, while regularly connecting individual choices to broader impacts. The process builds resilience through consistent practice rather than dramatic gestures.

In practical expression, this quality manifests as careful attention to daily choices, regular ethical reflection, and conscious investment in character development. It appears in how individuals handle small decisions, maintain awareness of their impact on others, and gradually build trust and respect through consistent ethical behavior. The quality becomes visible through patterns of choice over time rather than single actions, and through the gradual positive influence on relationships and community.

This universalization preserves the core wisdom of Jīdé while making it accessible across cultural contexts. It maintains the sophisticated understanding of moral development as cumulative while expressing it through universal human experiences and observable patterns. The description emphasizes both individual practice and collective impact, bridging personal development with social responsibility in a way that remains true to the original concept while being broadly applicable.

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universalization or address specific elements in more detail?
