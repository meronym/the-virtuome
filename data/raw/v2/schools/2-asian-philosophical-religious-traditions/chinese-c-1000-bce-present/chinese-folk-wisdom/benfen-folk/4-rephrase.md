Here's my attempt at a universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Role integrity is the conscious alignment of one's behavior with authentic responsibilities arising from one's position within social and professional contexts. It manifests as a deep understanding of appropriate boundaries, clear recognition of duties, and ethical fulfillment of obligations while maintaining personal authenticity.

[Essential Nature]
Role integrity emerges from the fundamental human need to function effectively within social structures while maintaining personal authenticity. It represents the sophisticated balance between social responsibility and individual expression, where external duties are not merely performed but internalized and integrated into one's identity. This quality enables individuals to navigate complex social expectations while preserving their authentic self, creating sustainable patterns of responsibility fulfillment.

[Manifestations]
- Clear understanding and acceptance of position-specific responsibilities
- Natural, unforced execution of role-based duties
- Appropriate boundary maintenance in professional and social contexts
- Balanced integration of personal authenticity with role requirements
- Consistent reliability in fulfilling responsibilities without resentment
- Development of role-specific wisdom and judgment
- Creation of trust through predictable ethical behavior

[Functional Description]
Role integrity operates through a dynamic process of understanding, accepting, and integrating position-specific responsibilities into one's identity. It develops through conscious attention to role requirements, reflection on appropriate boundaries, and progressive internalization of ethical standards. This quality grows through experience, mentorship, and intentional practice in various social contexts.

In practical terms, role integrity manifests as natural, unforced execution of responsibilities combined with appropriate boundary maintenance. It enables individuals to navigate complex social and professional environments while maintaining authenticity and building trust. This creates sustainable patterns of ethical behavior and facilitates both individual development and social harmony.
