Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF JÌNG (敬):
Core principle: Attentive reverence/cultivated seriousness
Functions: 
- Maintains mental focus
- Enables proper cultivation
- Ensures depth in learning/practice
- Sustains long-term development
Systemic role: Foundational attitude enabling all cultivation

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Deep concentration
- Sustained attention
- Earnest engagement
- Respectful awareness
Contemporary parallels:
- Mindfulness
- Professional dedication
- Deep work
- Conscious practice

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Primary:
- Focused awareness
- Sustained attention
- Earnest engagement
- Respectful attitude
Secondary:
- Mental scattered-ness (obstacle)
- Regular practice (condition)
- Concentration (related)
- Self-cultivation (application)

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of sustained, reverent attention that combines mental focus with earnest respect. It manifests as a fundamental attitude of serious engagement that infuses all activity with conscious awareness and careful consideration, enabling deep learning and authentic development.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the marriage of attention and respect - a specialized form of consciousness that is both focused and reverent. It differs from mere concentration by including an ethical dimension of appropriate seriousness and from simple respect by requiring active mental engagement. It serves as a foundational attitude that enables genuine learning, authentic self-development, and proper relationship to knowledge, tasks, and others.

At its core, it is the capacity to maintain unwavering attention while holding what one attends to in appropriate regard. This combination creates the conditions for deep understanding, genuine growth, and proper conduct in all domains of life.

[Manifestations]
- Sustained, careful attention in study or practice
- Respectful engagement with tasks, knowledge, and others
- Consistent mental presence without scattered-ness
- Appropriate seriousness in conduct and attitude
- Regular self-examination and reflection
- Careful consideration before action
- Maintenance of conscious awareness in solitude

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by establishing and maintaining a specific mode of consciousness that combines focus with respect. It acts as a stabilizing force for attention while simultaneously ensuring proper relationship to what is attended to. This dual function creates optimal conditions for learning, growth, and authentic engagement by preventing both mental scattered-ness and inappropriate casualness.

In practice, it manifests as a noticeable quality of presence and engagement that others can sense and respond to. It enables sustained effort in any endeavor, depth in learning and relationships, and appropriate behavior in all contexts. This quality develops through conscious practice and regular self-examination, gradually becoming a natural way of engaging with all aspects of life.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the core meaning of jìng while making it accessible
2. Maintains both practical and philosophical dimensions
3. Links individual practice to universal human experience
4. Describes observable manifestations
5. Explains developmental aspects
6. Shows contemporary relevance

The description should be meaningful across cultures while maintaining the sophistication of the original concept. It emphasizes experiential understanding over theoretical frameworks and connects individual practice to universal human capabilities.

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universalization?
