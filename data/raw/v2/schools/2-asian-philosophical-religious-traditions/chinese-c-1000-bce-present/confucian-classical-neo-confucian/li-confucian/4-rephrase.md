Let me work through this systematically for Lǐ (禮).

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Harmonious expression of inner cultivation through appropriate external form
Functions: 
- Orders social interactions
- Cultivates inner refinement
- Maintains cultural coherence
- Bridges individual and collective
- Embodies moral principles

Systemic role:
- Provides structure for moral expression
- Creates shared social grammar
- Enables cultural transmission
- Harmonizes inner/outer aspects

2. UNIVERSALIZATION
Universal experiences:
- Learning appropriate behavior
- Developing social grace
- Mastering cultural codes
- Harmonizing groups
- Personal refinement

Contemporary parallels:
- Professional etiquette
- Social intelligence
- Cultural competence
- Ceremonial meaning
- Behavioral ethics

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to embody inner development through refined external expression, creating harmony between self, others, and context. It manifests as the skillful navigation of social forms that elevates interactions beyond mere function to meaningful exchange, while cultivating both individual character and collective coherence.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the sophisticated integration of inner understanding with outer expression, where appropriate form becomes a vehicle for meaningful content. It operates at the intersection of personal cultivation and social harmony, transforming mechanical protocol into authentic manifestation of character. Unlike simple politeness or rule-following, it reflects deep comprehension of human relationships and social dynamics, expressed through actions that simultaneously honor individual dignity, strengthen social bonds, and elevate collective experience.

[Manifestations]
- Graceful adaptation of behavior to context without losing authenticity
- Natural embodiment of appropriate social forms that puts others at ease
- Elevation of ordinary interactions into meaningful exchanges
- Transformation of social obligations into opportunities for mutual growth
- Integration of personal sincerity with cultural forms
- Development of refined sensibility that intuitively grasps what each situation requires
- Creation of harmony through masterful navigation of social complexity

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive internalization of social wisdom, moving from conscious learning of forms to natural embodiment of principles. It begins with understanding appropriate behaviors, advances through grasp of underlying principles, and culminates in intuitive mastery where proper action flows spontaneously from developed character. The process requires sustained attention to both inner cultivation and outer expression, until these aspects become seamlessly integrated.

In practice, it manifests as an elegant synthesis of authenticity and appropriateness that elevates social interaction. Those who embody this quality naturally create environments of mutual respect and understanding, transforming potentially mechanical social exchanges into opportunities for meaningful connection and growth. Their presence tends to both dignify situations and put others at ease, demonstrating how refined behavior can serve as a vehicle for deeper human values.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the sophisticated understanding of form and content from Confucian thought
2. Makes the concept accessible without cultural prerequisites
3. Maintains practical applicability
4. Connects individual development to social harmony
5. Outlines clear developmental trajectory
6. Provides observable manifestations
7. Retains philosophical depth while ensuring practical relevance

The description passes the verification questions by:
1. Using universally recognizable experiences and observations
2. Maintaining the sophisticated relationship between inner and outer development
3. Providing clear practical manifestations
4. Connecting personal development to collective harmony
5. Outlining clear developmental progression
6. Offering observable behavioral markers

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
