Let me follow the process step by step for Xìn (信).

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
- Core: Fundamental reliability/coherence between inner state and outer expression
- Functions: Enables social trust, maintains relationship integrity, creates predictability
- Systemic role: Foundation for sustainable relationships and social order
- Development: Progresses from basic honesty to deep authenticity

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
- Universal experiences: Promise-keeping, truth-telling, reliability, consistency
- Cross-cultural parallels: Integrity, authenticity, trustworthiness
- Contemporary relevance: Professional reliability, relationship trust, social cohesion
- Timeless patterns: Alignment of word/action, inner/outer coherence

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of deep reliability that emerges when one's inner state, expressed intentions, and actual behavior align consistently over time. It manifests as trustworthiness in relationships, authenticity in self-expression, and dependability in action, forming the foundation for sustainable human connections and social coherence.

[Essential Nature]
At its core, this quality represents the natural coherence between inner truth and outer expression. It isn't merely about keeping promises or being honest, but about maintaining fundamental integrity between one's authentic being and its manifestation in the world. This alignment creates a field of reliability that others can sense and trust, enabling deeper relationships and sustained cooperation.

This quality develops through consistent practice of aligning thought, word, and action, gradually building an unshakeable core of authenticity that others can depend upon. It requires both self-awareness to maintain inner truth and social awareness to express it appropriately.

[Manifestations]
- Natural alignment between stated intentions and actual behavior
- Consistent reliability in fulfilling commitments
- Authentic self-expression that others can trust and depend upon
- Steady presence that creates safety in relationships
- Observable integrity between principles and actions
- Capacity to maintain long-term commitments despite challenges

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by creating and maintaining coherence between internal states and external expressions. It begins with small acts of keeping one's word and gradually develops into a stable character trait of deep reliability. As it matures, it becomes less about conscious effort and more about natural authenticity, creating an unshakeable foundation that others can sense and trust. This coherence generates a field of reliability that supports all forms of human cooperation and relationship.

In practical terms, this quality enables sustainable relationships, effective collaboration, and social stability. It manifests in the professional world as reliability and integrity, in personal relationships as emotional dependability and authentic presence, and in society as the capacity for sustained cooperation and trust-building. Its absence makes meaningful human connection and collaboration difficult, while its presence creates the foundation for all forms of human flourishing.
