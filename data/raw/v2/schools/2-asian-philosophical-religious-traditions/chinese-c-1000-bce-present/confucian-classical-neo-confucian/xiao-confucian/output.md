[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive awareness of one's dependence on and debt to others, particularly those who have contributed to one's existence and development. It begins with natural gratitude, matures through understanding of sacrifices made on one's behalf, and culminates in the conscious choice to honor and extend received care and wisdom. This development transforms natural feeling into cultivated virtue through reflection, practice, and commitment.

In practical expression, it manifests as consistent care for those who have contributed to one's life, active preservation and development of received wisdom, and conscious transmission of enhanced value to future generations. It creates a sustainable chain of human development where received care and wisdom are not merely preserved but enhanced through grateful stewardship and thoughtful development.
