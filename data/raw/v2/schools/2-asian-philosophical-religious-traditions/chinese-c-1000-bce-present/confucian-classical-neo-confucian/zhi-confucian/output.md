[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the continuous interplay of learning and experience, where theoretical understanding is tested and refined through practical application. It begins with the acquisition of knowledge, develops through reflection on experience, and matures into an intuitive grasp of principles that can be applied spontaneously and appropriately. The process involves both analytical understanding and experiential learning, leading to increasingly refined judgment.

In practice, it manifests as the ability to navigate complex situations with clarity and effectiveness, making decisions that account for both immediate circumstances and broader principles.
