Let me analyze Gōngyì (公義) systematically before crafting the universal description.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Impartial care and fairness based on rational assessment
Key functions:
- Equal consideration of all parties
- Objective decision-making
- Universal standard application
- Fair resource/opportunity distribution

Relationship patterns:
- Supports universal love (jiān'ài)
- Enables meritocratic systems
- Balances individual/collective interests
- Facilitates social harmony

Developmental aspects:
- Progression from instinctive fairness to systematic impartiality
- Growth from personal to universal perspective
- Evolution from rule-following to principled judgment

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Sense of fairness
- Need for equal treatment
- Quest for objective standards
- Desire for just outcomes

Contemporary applications:
- Organizational decision-making
- Policy development
- Conflict resolution
- Resource allocation

Based on this analysis, here's the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to perceive, judge, and act with genuine impartiality, maintaining equal consideration for all while applying universal standards based on objective benefit rather than personal preference or relationship. This quality enables fair assessment and action that serves collective welfare while honoring individual dignity.

[Essential Nature]
Impartial justice represents the human capacity to transcend personal bias and particular attachments to perceive and act from a universal perspective. It combines clear-sighted observation, rational assessment, and principled action, creating a bridge between individual conscience and collective welfare. This quality manifests as both an internal compass for decision-making and an external framework for social organization, enabling fair and beneficial outcomes at all scales of human interaction.

[Manifestations]
- Equal consideration of all relevant perspectives when making decisions
- Consistent application of principles regardless of personal relationship
- Rational assessment of situations based on objective criteria
- Fair distribution of resources and opportunities based on merit and need
- Balance between individual rights and collective benefit
- Systematic evaluation procedures that minimize bias
- Development of universal standards that transcend particular interests

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dual process of internal cultivation and external implementation. Internally, it develops through progressive refinement of judgment, moving from intuitive fairness to systematic impartiality. This development requires continuous self-examination to recognize and transcend personal biases, while strengthening the capacity to perceive situations from multiple perspectives. The quality grows through practical experience in making difficult decisions that balance competing interests.

In practice, this quality enables effective governance, fair conflict resolution, and sustainable social harmony. It manifests in the creation and maintenance of systems that distribute resources and opportunities based on objective criteria rather than personal preference. When fully developed, it allows for decision-making that naturally aligns individual and collective interests, creating outcomes that benefit all parties while maintaining universal standards of fairness.
```

This universal description aims to:
- Capture the Mohist emphasis on rational, impartial judgment
- Translate the concept into experiential terms
- Maintain philosophical sophistication while ensuring accessibility
- Connect individual development to social impact
- Provide clear practical applications
- Preserve the systematic nature of the original concept

The description should be meaningful across cultures while maintaining the depth and practical applicability of the original Mohist concept. It connects individual development with universal principles and provides observable manifestations that can guide practice and verification.

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universal description?
