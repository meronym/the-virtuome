      "content": "Let me analyze this carefully to distill the most representative virtues of Mohism:\n\nANALYTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n\n1. CORE PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION\nMohism was fundamentally a practical, utilitarian philosophy focused on:\n- Maximizing societal benefit\n- Promoting universal ethical standards\n- Emphasizing measurable results\n- Advocating rational approaches to problems\n\n2. DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS\nWhat made Mohism unique in Chinese thought was:\n- Opposition to Confucian familial preference\n- Emphasis on universal rather than graduated love\n- Focus on practical benefit over ritual\n- Merit-based rather than hereditary values\n- Scientific/logical approach to ethics\n\n3. HIERARCHY OF VIRTUES\nIn Mohist thought, virtues appear to be valued based on:\n- Their contribution to collective welfare\n- Their practical utility\n- Their universal applicability\n- Their measurable effects\n\n4. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION\nMohists were concerned with:\n- How virtues could be practically applied\n- Their demonstrable benefits\n- Their teachability and reproducibility\n- Their social scalability\n\nBased on these considerations, I would propose the following shortlist of core Mohist virtues, organized in conceptual clusters:\n\nFOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES:\n1. Universal Love (\u517c\u611b, ji\u0101n'\u00e0i)\n- The cornerstone of Mohist ethics\n- Represents their most distinctive contribution\n- Opposes Confucian graduated love\n- Foundation for other virtues\n\n2. Practical Wisdom (\u77e5, zh\u012b)\n- Rational understanding\n- Evidence-based thinking\n- Technical competence\n- Problem-solving ability\n\nSOCIAL IMPLEMENTATION:\n3.

Impartial Care (\u516c\u7fa9, g\u014dngy\u00ec)\n- Fair treatment\n- Equal consideration\n- Universal application\n- Ethical consistency\n\nPRACTICAL VIRTUES:\n5. Productive Diligence (\u52e4\u52de, q\u00ednl\u00e1o)\n- Industrious effort\n- Practical contribution\n- Skilled work\n- Beneficial action\n\n6. Frugal Efficiency (\u7bc0\u7528, ji\u00e9y\u00f2ng)\n- Resource optimization\n- Practical thrift\n- Sustainable use\n- Economic wisdom\n\nSOCIAL HARMONY:\n7. Peaceful Order (\u975e\u653b, f\u0113ig\u014dng)\n- Conflict prevention\n- Defensive capability\n- Social stability\n- Just protection\n\n8. Collective Benefit (\u7fa4\u5229, q\u00fan l\u00ec)\n- Social welfare\n- Community good\n- Shared prosperity\n- Common advantage\n\nRATIONAL GOVERNANCE:\n9. Administrative Competence (\u6cbb\u80fd, zh\u00ec n\u00e9ng)\n- Effective management\n- Practical leadership\n- Technical skill\n- Result-oriented governance\n\nThis shortlist captures:\n- The practical orientation of Mohism\n- Its focus on universal standards\n- Its emphasis on measurable benefits\n- Its rational approach to ethics\n- Its concern for collective welfare\n\nEach virtue selected represents either:\n- A fundamental principle of Mohist thought\n- A distinctive contribution to Chinese philosophy\n- A practical application of Mohist ideals\n- An essential aspect of their social vision\n\nWould you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML+Markdown nodes for these nine core virtues?"
