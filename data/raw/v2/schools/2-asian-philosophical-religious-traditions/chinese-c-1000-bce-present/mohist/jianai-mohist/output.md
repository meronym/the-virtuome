[Core Definition]
The capacity to extend equal care and consideration to all human beings, transcending natural affinities and social boundaries through conscious cultivation of universal goodwill. This quality manifests as the practical ability to make decisions and take actions based on collective benefit rather than personal preference or group loyalty.

[Essential Nature]
Universal care represents the expansion of human empathic capacity beyond its natural limitations. While humans naturally favor family and immediate group members, this quality develops through conscious recognition of shared humanity and intentional cultivation of impartial goodwill. It operates not as an abstract principle but as a practical capability to consider and act for the welfare of all affected parties, regardless of relationship or affiliation.

[Manifestations]
- Equal consideration in decision-making despite varying relationships
- Active concern for welfare of strangers and outgroup members
- Practical assistance based on need rather than affiliation
- Impartial resource allocation and opportunity distribution
- Recognition and mitigation of unconscious biases
- Balancing particular responsibilities with universal care
- Development of expanding circles of moral consideration

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive expansion of natural empathic capacity, supported by rational understanding of human interconnection and practical experience with diverse groups. It begins with recognition of bias in our natural affiliations, advances through intentional cultivation of impartial consideration, and matures into spontaneous recognition of universal human value. The process involves both emotional development (expanding empathy) and cognitive development (understanding interconnection).

In practice, universal care manifests as the ability to make decisions that benefit the whole while respecting particular relationships. It enables navigation of competing claims through impartial consideration rather than automatic preference, leading to choices that maximize collective benefit. This quality supports social cohesion by transcending group boundaries while acknowledging the reality of specific responsibilities and relationships.
