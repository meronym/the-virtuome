Let me follow the analytical process and then provide the universal reformulation.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Strategic peace-orientation through rational assessment
Key functions: 
- Conflict prevention
- Defense preparation
- Cost-benefit evaluation
- Stability maintenance

Universal experiences:
- Need for security
- Desire for peace
- Balance of protection/aggression
- Community preservation instinct

Systemic role:
- Social stability maintainer
- Resource preserver
- Life protector
- Progress enabler

Here's the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain peace through wisdom and preparation, combining strong defensive capability with principled restraint from aggression. This quality manifests as the intelligent preservation of stability while maintaining readiness to protect what is valuable, guided by careful assessment of consequences and commitment to minimizing harm.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the sophisticated balance between protective strength and peaceful intention. It differs from passive pacifism by acknowledging the need for defensive capability, while rejecting aggressive force as counterproductive. At its heart lies the recognition that genuine security emerges from a combination of adequate preparation and wise restraint, guided by clear evaluation of long-term consequences rather than immediate tactical advantage.

This stance requires the integration of multiple capabilities: strategic assessment, ethical judgment, technical preparation, and the wisdom to know when and how to deploy or withhold force. It manifests as a dynamic balance rather than a fixed position.

[Manifestations]
- Development of protective capabilities while maintaining clear peaceful intention
- Careful assessment of situations to distinguish genuine threats from perceived ones
- Investment in prevention and de-escalation strategies
- Maintenance of preparedness while actively seeking peaceful solutions
- Building strength that deters aggression without provoking it
- Creation of stability through demonstrated capability paired with clear restraint
- Development of community resilience through coordinated protective measures

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through continuous dynamic assessment of potential threats and appropriate responses, always preferring prevention and de-escalation while maintaining sufficient strength to ensure security. It requires developing sophisticated judgment about when and how to deploy protective measures, while consistently working to create conditions that make conflict less likely. The focus remains on creating sustainable peace rather than temporary advantage.

In practice, this manifests as investment in protective infrastructure, development of defensive capabilities, and cultivation of de-escalation skills, all while maintaining clear communication about peaceful intentions. Success is measured not by dominance but by the sustained absence of conflict combined with robust community security. This approach recognizes that true strength lies in the ability to maintain peace through wisdom rather than force.

This universal reformulation:
- Preserves the sophisticated strategic thinking of the original concept
- Makes it applicable beyond military contexts to all forms of conflict
- Maintains the rational cost-benefit analysis aspect
- Emphasizes the practical wisdom component
- Links individual and collective dimensions
- Highlights developmental aspects
- Provides clear observable manifestations

The description should be meaningful across cultures while maintaining the philosophical sophistication of the original Mohist concept. It connects to universal human experiences of conflict and security while providing practical guidance for implementation.

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this reformulation further?
