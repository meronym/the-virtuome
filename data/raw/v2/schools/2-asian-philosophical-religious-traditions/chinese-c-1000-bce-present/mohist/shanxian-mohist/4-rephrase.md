Let me follow the structured process to universalize Shàngxián (尚賢):

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Recognition and cultivation of genuine capability/excellence
Key functions:
- Merit identification
- Talent development
- Fair evaluation
- Competence rewards
- Skill cultivation

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Recognition of differing abilities
- Development of expertise
- Fair assessment needs
- Growth through competence
- Achievement recognition

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary pattern: Excellence cultivation through objective recognition
Supporting conditions: Fair evaluation systems, growth opportunities
Obstacles: Bias, nepotism, false metrics
Systemic role: Social optimization through competence alignment

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The recognition, cultivation, and advancement of genuine human capability, expressing as an integrated approach to identifying, developing, and appropriately positioning excellence in service of collective flourishing. This quality manifests through objective evaluation, fair opportunity creation, and systematic talent development.

[Essential Nature]
At its core, this quality represents the human capacity to recognize and nurture excellence in its authentic forms, transcending superficial markers or inherited privilege. It operates through the systematic identification of genuine capability, coupled with the active creation of conditions for its development and appropriate expression. This recognition-cultivation-positioning dynamic serves both individual growth and collective advancement, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of capability development and meaningful contribution.

[Manifestations]
- Objective evaluation systems that accurately identify genuine capability
- Active creation of growth and development opportunities
- Fair recognition and positioning of demonstrated excellence
- Systematic cultivation of potential into actualized capability
- Integration of individual talent with collective benefit
- Progressive advancement based on demonstrated growth
- Creation of merit-based development pathways

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay of recognition and development, where genuine capability is identified through objective observation and systematically cultivated through appropriate challenges and opportunities. It creates feedback loops between individual growth and collective benefit, where demonstrated excellence naturally leads to increased responsibility and opportunity for contribution.

In practice, this manifests as the creation of fair evaluation systems, development pathways, and advancement opportunities based on demonstrated capability rather than external factors. It generates environments where genuine excellence is recognized, nurtured, and positioned for maximum positive impact, fostering both individual growth and collective advancement through the optimal alignment of capability with opportunity.

This universalization preserves key aspects of Shàngxián while making it accessible across cultural contexts:

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Centers on universal human experiences of capability recognition and development
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding of merit-based development
3. Practical applicability: Clear implications for evaluation and development systems
4. Individual-universal connection: Links personal capability to collective benefit
5. Development clarity: Shows progression from potential to actualized capability
6. Observable manifestations: Concrete expressions in systems and practices

The description maintains the sophisticated Mohist understanding while making it accessible and applicable in contemporary contexts, preserving both philosophical depth and practical utility.
