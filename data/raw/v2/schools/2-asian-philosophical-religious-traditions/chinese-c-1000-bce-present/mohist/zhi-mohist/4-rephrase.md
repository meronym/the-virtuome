Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS FOR ZHĪ (知):
Core principle: Practical wisdom oriented towards beneficial outcomes
Key functions: 
- Empirical observation
- Problem-solving capacity
- Technical competence
- Result verification
- Knowledge application

Relationship patterns:
- Bridges theory and practice
- Connects knowledge to action
- Links individual skill to collective benefit
- Integrates observation with implementation

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Learning through direct experience
- Solving practical problems
- Developing technical mastery
- Verifying what works
- Applying knowledge effectively

Contemporary parallels:

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to understand reality through direct observation and experience, combined with the ability to apply this understanding effectively to solve practical problems and achieve beneficial outcomes. This wisdom manifests as a dynamic integration of knowledge, skill, and judgment oriented toward concrete results.

[Essential Nature]
Practical wisdom emerges from the intersection of direct experience, systematic observation, and purposeful action. It represents the human capacity to grasp how things actually work and apply this understanding effectively. Unlike purely theoretical knowledge or intuitive insight, this quality combines careful observation with verified effectiveness, always oriented toward practical benefit and demonstrable results.

This wisdom develops through active engagement with real challenges, systematic testing of ideas, and continuous refinement based on outcomes. It values what works over what should work, while maintaining rigorous standards for verification and effectiveness.

[Manifestations]
- Clear perception of cause and effect relationships in practical situations
- Ability to identify effective solutions through systematic observation and testing
- Skill in applying knowledge to achieve beneficial results
- Capacity to verify understanding through practical demonstration
- Integration of theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience
- Development of reliable technical competence through practice
- Pattern recognition leading to improved problem-solving

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous cycle of observation, testing, and refinement. It begins with direct perception of reality, develops through systematic experimentation, and matures through repeated application in practical contexts. The process integrates theoretical understanding with empirical verification, always maintaining a focus on actual results rather than assumed effectiveness.

In practice, this wisdom manifests as the ability to solve real problems efficiently, develop reliable technical skills, and achieve beneficial outcomes consistently. It enables individuals to move beyond both blind tradition and untested theory, instead building understanding through direct observation and verified effectiveness. This approach leads to demonstrable competence and reliable capability in addressing practical challenges.

This universalized description:
1. Maintains the core Mohist emphasis on practical effectiveness
2. Preserves the empirical/experimental aspect
3. Retains the focus on beneficial outcomes
4. Translates technical competence into universal terms
5. Keeps the result-oriented nature of the concept

The description connects to universal human experiences of:
- Learning through practice
- Developing practical competence
- Solving real problems
- Verifying what works
- Achieving beneficial results

It remains true to the original Mohist concept while making it accessible and relevant across cultural contexts. The emphasis on practical effectiveness and verified results maintains the distinctive character of Mohist thought while expressing it in universal terms.

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universalization?
