Let me follow the process systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
- Core: Competence-based governance/leadership focused on measurable results
- Functions: Decision-making, resource allocation, organizational effectiveness
- Systemic Role: Links individual capability to collective benefit
- Development: Progressive mastery of practical leadership skills

UNIVERSALIZATION:
- Universal Experience: Managing collective efforts effectively
- Parallel Concepts: Technical competence, evidence-based leadership, practical wisdom in governance
- Contemporary Applications: Modern management, public administration, organizational leadership
- Timeless Pattern: The relationship between competence and effective collective action

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to effectively guide collective efforts through demonstrated competence, practical wisdom, and measurable results rather than authority alone. It combines technical knowledge, organizational skill, and outcome-focused decision-making to achieve beneficial results for the whole group.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the integration of practical capability with leadership responsibility, emphasizing measurable effectiveness over formal position or traditional authority. It manifests as the ability to understand complex systems, make evidence-based decisions, and implement solutions that create demonstrable benefits. At its core, it embodies the principle that legitimate leadership emerges from proven ability to generate positive outcomes rather than from status or position alone.

[Manifestations]
- Clear decision-making based on verifiable evidence and practical reasoning
- Systematic approach to problem-solving that considers multiple factors and outcomes
- Effective resource allocation guided by measurable benefits rather than tradition or preference
- Continuous improvement through feedback and outcome assessment
- Development of systems and procedures that enhance collective capability
- Active cultivation of practical expertise within the organization
- Balanced consideration of immediate results and long-term sustainability

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through the continuous interaction between practical knowledge and organizational responsibility. It develops through progressive mastery of technical skills, systematic thinking, and outcome measurement, creating a feedback loop between actions and results. The leader's competence becomes visible through the improved functioning of the collective system rather than through personal authority or status.

In practice, this quality transforms abstract leadership potential into concrete beneficial outcomes. It manifests as the ability to identify what works, implement effective solutions, and continuously refine approaches based on measurable results. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where demonstrated competence enhances authority, which in turn enables more effective action for collective benefit.

This universalization maintains the core Mohist emphasis on:
- Practical results over formal authority
- Measurable benefits over traditional status
- Technical competence over hereditary position
- Collective benefit over individual privilege

While making it relevant to:
- Modern organizational leadership
- Evidence-based management
- Technical governance
- Practical administration

The description preserves the sophisticated relationship between:
- Individual capability and collective benefit
- Technical knowledge and practical application
- Authority and demonstrated competence
- Process efficiency and outcome effectiveness

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the objectives?
