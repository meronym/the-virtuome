Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Qún lì (群利):
- Core principle: Collective benefit/welfare optimization
- Key functions: Social cohesion, resource distribution, shared prosperity
- Systemic role: Guides decision-making toward communal good
- Developmental aspects: Individual→Group→Society→Universal benefit

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
- Universal experiences: Community wellbeing, shared resources, collective achievement
- Parallel concepts: Public good, social welfare, common benefit
- Contemporary applications: Sustainable development, public policy, community initiatives
- Timeless patterns: Mutual benefit, collective progress, shared prosperity

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, create, and optimize collective benefit, manifesting as the active promotion of conditions that enhance the wellbeing of the whole while ensuring sustainable prosperity for all participants within a system. This quality transcends mere individual advantage to embrace comprehensive communal thriving.

[Essential Nature]
Collective benefit optimization represents a fundamental shift from individual-centric to system-aware consciousness. It manifests as an integrated understanding that true prosperity emerges from the harmonious enhancement of whole-system wellbeing rather than maximizing individual gains. This quality combines practical wisdom about resource distribution with deep insight into the interconnected nature of human flourishing.

This capacity involves both analytical understanding of systemic dynamics and intuitive awareness of collective needs. It operates through recognizing opportunities for mutual benefit, identifying synergistic solutions, and implementing practices that generate sustainable prosperity for the broader community while maintaining individual vitality.

[Manifestations]
- Recognition of opportunities that serve both individual and collective interests
- Development of solutions that multiply benefits across system levels
- Creation of sustainable practices that enhance communal resources
- Implementation of decisions that optimize long-term collective wellbeing
- Cultivation of structures that support equitable distribution of benefits
- Facilitation of collaborative efforts that generate shared value
- Integration of individual contributions into collective advancement

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay of awareness, analysis, and action. It begins with expanded perception that recognizes the interconnected nature of wellbeing, develops through systematic understanding of how benefits can be optimized across multiple levels, and manifests in practical initiatives that enhance collective prosperity. The capacity grows through iterative cycles of observation, implementation, and refinement, continuously adapting to evolving communal needs and opportunities.

In practical expression, this quality transforms decision-making processes, resource allocation, and social interaction patterns. It leads to the development of initiatives that generate multiple layers of benefit, creation of self-reinforcing positive cycles, and establishment of structures that support sustainable collective prosperity. This results in enhanced social cohesion, more efficient resource utilization, and increased overall system vitality.

This universalization maintains the core Mohist emphasis on practical benefit while making it accessible to contemporary understanding. It preserves the sophisticated analysis of collective welfare while expressing it in terms relevant to modern challenges of sustainable development and social optimization.

The description satisfies our verification questions by:
1. Using universally recognizable phenomena and experiences
2. Maintaining the philosophical depth of Mohist thought
3. Providing clear practical applications
4. Connecting individual actions to collective outcomes
5. Outlining developmental progression
6. Specifying observable manifestations

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet our objectives?
