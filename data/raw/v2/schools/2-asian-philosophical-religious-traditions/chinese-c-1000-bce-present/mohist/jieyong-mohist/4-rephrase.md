Let me analyze Jiéyòng systematically before composing the universal description.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Resource optimization aligned with true need and benefit
Key functions:
- Intelligent resource allocation
- Waste prevention
- Sustainable consumption
- Value maximization
- Long-term benefit focus

Relationship patterns:
- Links individual choices to collective welfare
- Connects material efficiency to moral virtue
- Bridges practical action and ethical principle
- Integrates personal and social benefit

Developmental aspects:
- Starts with basic restraint
- Develops into intelligent optimization
- Matures into strategic resource wisdom
- Culminates in sustainable prosperity mindset

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Resource limitation
- Need for efficiency
- Sustainability challenges
- Balance of use vs. preservation
- Long-term vs. short-term choices

Contemporary relevance:
- Environmental sustainability
- Resource management
- Economic efficiency
- Ethical consumption
- Organizational optimization

Based on this analysis, here's the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to optimize resource use through intelligent restraint and strategic efficiency, creating maximum benefit while minimizing waste. It combines practical wisdom in resource management with ethical consideration of long-term collective welfare, manifesting as both personal virtue and systematic approach to sustainability.

[Essential Nature]
Resourceful efficiency represents the sophisticated balance between utilization and conservation, transcending simple frugality to embrace strategic optimization. It operates through the conscious alignment of resource use with genuine need and maximum benefit, guided by both practical wisdom and ethical consideration. This quality manifests as an integrated approach to value creation, where careful resource management serves both immediate functional needs and long-term collective welfare.

[Manifestations]
- Thoughtful evaluation of necessity before resource commitment
- Strategic optimization of available resources for maximum benefit
- Development of innovative solutions that achieve more with less
- Creation of sustainable systems that eliminate waste
- Integration of immediate utility with long-term preservation
- Cultivation of prosperity through intelligent resource stewardship
- Balance of individual needs with collective welfare in resource decisions

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of resource awareness and management capability. It begins with basic restraint and waste prevention, evolves through development of optimization skills and strategic thinking, and matures into comprehensive resource wisdom that naturally aligns personal choices with collective benefit. The process involves growing awareness of resource interconnections, developing sophisticated evaluation skills, and cultivating long-term perspective.

In practice, it manifests as systematic approach to value creation that transcends mere conservation. It guides decision-making at all scales, from personal choices to organizational systems, promoting innovative solutions that maximize benefit while minimizing resource investment. This creates sustainable prosperity through intelligent optimization rather than restriction, transforming resource limitations into opportunities for innovation and improvement.

This universal description:
1. Preserves the sophisticated Mohist understanding of resource optimization
2. Connects to contemporary sustainability challenges
3. Maintains both practical and ethical dimensions
4. Translates classical wisdom into modern context
5. Provides clear developmental pathway
6. Offers concrete manifestations
7. Links individual practice to collective benefit

The description should be meaningful across cultures while maintaining the depth and sophistication of the original Mohist concept. It emphasizes observable manifestations and practical applications while preserving the underlying philosophical principles.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universal description?
