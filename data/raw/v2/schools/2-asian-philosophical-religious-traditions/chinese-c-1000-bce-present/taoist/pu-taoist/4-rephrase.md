Let me first analyze PÇ” systematically before composing the universal description.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Original simplicity/authenticity before social conditioning
Key functions:
- Returns to basic nature
- Removes artificial complexity
- Maintains natural potential
- Preserves genuine responses
Systemic role: Foundation for authentic development

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Child-like directness
- Moments of pure presence
- Natural spontaneity
- Uncluttered awareness
Contemporary relevance:
- Minimalism
- Authentic living
- Mental clarity
- Decision-making
- Stress reduction

Here's the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of original simplicity and wholeness that exists before fragmentation or artificial complexity. It represents our capacity to return to and operate from a state of natural authenticity, unburdened by accumulated patterns and pretenses.

[Essential Nature]
Original simplicity manifests as a state of pure potential and uncluttered presence, like a blank canvas or uncarved wood. It's not primitive simplicity, but rather the sophisticated simplicity that remains when unnecessary complexity is removed. This quality enables direct, uncontrived engagement with life, unmediated by conceptual overlays or social conditioning. It combines receptivity with completeness, emptiness with potential, maintaining the capacity for appropriate response without predetermined patterns.

[Manifestations]
- Direct, uncontrived responses to situations
- Natural clarity in perception and decision-making
- Absence of unnecessary complexity in action and thought
- Child-like immediacy without childishness
- Freedom from compulsive patterns and pretense
- Sustainable simplicity in lifestyle and relationships
- Genuine presence unmarred by social masks

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a process of removal rather than addition, clearing away accumulated patterns, pretenses, and unnecessary complications to reveal natural functioning. It develops not through acquisition of new capabilities but through the recovery of original nature, like clearing dust from a mirror or removing sediment from water. The process involves both active simplification and passive allowing.

In practical expression, this quality manifests as remarkable effectiveness through simplicity. It enables clear perception unclouded by preconceptions, natural responses unhindered by overthinking, and authentic presence unmarred by social performance. This creates a sustainable foundation for action, relationship, and development based on genuine rather than artificial qualities.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural? Yes - draws on universal human experiences of authenticity and simplicity
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear implications for behavior and development
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal authenticity to universal patterns
5. Development clarity? Yes - describes both process and manifestations
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - listed concrete expressions

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this description or elaborate on specific elements?
