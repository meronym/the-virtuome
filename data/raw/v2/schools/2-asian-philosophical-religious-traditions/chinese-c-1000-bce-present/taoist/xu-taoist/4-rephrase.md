Let me follow the process systematically for Xū (虛):

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Receptive openness that enables potential
Functions: Creates space for possibility, enables clear perception, allows natural flow
Systemic role: Foundational capacity that enables other qualities to develop
Developmental: Moves from physical to mental to spiritual emptiness

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- The clarity that comes after mental decluttering
- The creativity enabled by open mental space
- The wisdom of "beginner's mind"
- The peace found in letting go

Here's the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of receptive openness that creates space for possibility and enables clear perception. Like a vessel's empty space that gives it utility, this internal spaciousness allows for fresh experience, understanding, and potential to arise naturally. It manifests as mental clarity, perceptual freshness, and adaptive capacity.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the fundamental capacity for openness that exists prior to accumulated content, patterns, or constructs. It operates like space itself - not an absence or void, but a positive quality that enables existence and movement. It manifests initially as the ability to empty the mind of preconceptions and mental clutter, developing into a deeper state of receptive awareness that allows direct, unfiltered experience of reality.

This openness serves as a foundation for wisdom, creativity, and growth by creating the conditions for fresh perception and understanding. It enables us to meet each moment anew, free from the distortions of predetermined thoughts and reactive patterns.

[Manifestations]
- Mental clarity and spaciousness that allows clear thinking
- Perceptual freshness that enables direct experience
- Responsive adaptability in changing situations
- Non-attachment to fixed views or outcomes
- Capacity to learn and integrate new understanding
- Natural wisdom that arises from uncluttered awareness
- Creative potential activated by internal space

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by continuously releasing accumulated mental content - thoughts, assumptions, fixed patterns - to maintain inner spaciousness. Like regularly emptying a cup allows it to receive fresh water, this ongoing release of mental constructs enables direct perception and fresh response. It develops through deliberate practice of letting go, combined with cultivation of present-moment awareness and non-attachment to mental contents.

In practical application, this manifests as the ability to approach situations without preconceptions, respond adaptively to change, and maintain clarity under pressure. It enables learning, creativity, and wisdom by creating the internal conditions for new understanding to arise. This quality becomes particularly valuable in complex or challenging situations where habitual responses are inadequate and fresh perception is needed.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural? Yes - based on universal human capacity for open awareness
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language
3. Practical? Yes - clear applications in daily life and development
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal experience to universal principle
5. Development clear? Yes - shows progression from basic to advanced manifestations
6. Observable? Yes - manifestations are concrete and verifiable

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universal reformulation?
