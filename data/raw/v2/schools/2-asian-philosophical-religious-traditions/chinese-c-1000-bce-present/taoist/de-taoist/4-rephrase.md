Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Dé (德):
Core principle: Natural power/potency arising from alignment with deeper reality
Key functions: 
- Authenticates action
- Generates influence
- Manifests wisdom
- Harmonizes relationships
Systemic role: Bridge between individual cultivation and universal principles

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Natural authority/presence
- Earned respect
- Authentic influence
- Character-based impact
- Integration of wisdom and action

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Natural power through alignment
- Authentic presence
- Effortless influence
- Character cultivation

Secondary:
- Integration of being and doing
- Balance of receptivity and action
- Relationship between personal and universal
- Natural vs. forced authority

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The natural power and influence that emerges when one's character and actions align with deeper principles of reality. Unlike imposed authority or forced influence, it manifests as an effortless capacity to affect positive change through presence and authentic being rather than deliberate doing.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the integration of personal development with universal principles, manifesting as a form of power that doesn't arise from position, force, or technique, but from the depth and authenticity of one's character. It develops through sustained alignment between inner nature and outer action, creating a natural authority that influences without imposing and leads without controlling.

Unlike conventional power which operates through external means, this quality works through presence and example, radiating influence naturally like heat from fire or fragrance from flowers. It becomes stronger through letting go of artificial effort, allowing one's cultivated nature to express itself spontaneously and appropriately.

[Manifestations]
- Natural authority that draws respect without demanding it
- Effortless positive influence on others and situations
- Authentic presence that naturally harmonizes environments
- Actions that align spontaneously with optimal outcomes
- Character-based impact that operates without force or manipulation
- Wisdom expressed through being rather than just knowing
- Integration of personal cultivation with universal principles

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive alignment of one's character with deeper principles of reality, creating a form of power that operates through authenticity rather than technique. As artificial effort diminishes and natural character strengthens, influence becomes more effortless and profound. The development process involves both active cultivation and the paradoxical practice of letting go of deliberate forcing.

In practical expression, this manifests as a form of leadership and influence that operates primarily through example and presence rather than direct intervention. It creates change through inspiration rather than imposition, leading others to their own authentic development rather than forcing specific outcomes. This quality becomes particularly evident in crisis or challenge, where its stabilizing influence operates automatically without conscious effort.

This universalized description:
- Preserves the core Taoist insight about natural power vs. forced power
- Makes the concept accessible without requiring Taoist metaphysical framework
- Maintains the sophisticated relationship between personal cultivation and universal principles
- Provides clear markers for practical development and manifestation
- Links individual experience to universal patterns
- Keeps the paradoxical nature of effort/non-effort cultivation

The description validates against our verification questions:
1. Cross-cultural meaning ✓ (uses universal human experiences)
2. Preserves depth ✓ (maintains sophisticated philosophical elements)
3. Practical applicability ✓ (clear manifestations and development path)
4. Individual-universal connection ✓ (links personal cultivation to universal principles)
5. Development clarity ✓ (describes both cultivation and spontaneous manifestation)
6. Observable manifestations ✓ (clear behavioral and impact markers)

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
