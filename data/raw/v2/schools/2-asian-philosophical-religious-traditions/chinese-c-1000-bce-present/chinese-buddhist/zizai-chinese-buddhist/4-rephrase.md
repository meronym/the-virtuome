Let me follow the analytical process step by step:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Natural, unconstricted functioning aligned with reality
Key functions: 
- Effortless appropriate response
- Freedom from artificial constraints
- Spontaneous wisdom expression
- Natural authenticity

Relationship patterns:
- Emerges from deep understanding
- Enables fluid adaptation
- Supports authentic interaction
- Facilitates wisdom expression

Developmental aspects:
- Begins with releasing forced effort
- Develops through acceptance
- Matures into natural functioning
- Culminates in effortless wisdom

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Flow states
- Natural competence
- Authentic self-expression
- Effortless mastery

Contemporary applications:
- Professional excellence
- Leadership presence
- Artistic expression
- Personal relationships

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of natural, unconstricted functioning that emerges when artificial effort falls away, characterized by spontaneous appropriateness and effortless engagement with life. It manifests as fluid competence, authentic presence, and immediate responsiveness unbound by conceptual constraints or self-consciousness.

[Essential Nature]
Natural ease represents the intrinsic freedom and functionality inherent in human consciousness when unburdened by excessive self-reference or artificial effort. It is not a manufactured state but rather the natural condition that emerges when unnecessary interference subsides. Like water finding its own level or a skilled artist working without self-consciousness, this quality manifests as immediate, appropriate response to circumstances without the friction of overthinking or forced effort.

[Manifestations]
- Fluid adaptation to changing circumstances without hesitation or strain
- Spontaneous appropriate response without calculation or deliberation
- Natural authenticity unmarred by self-consciousness or pretense
- Effortless competence in one's domain of expertise
- Immediate presence unconstrained by conceptual overlays
- Graceful navigation of complex situations without forced effort

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by allowing our natural intelligence and capabilities to function without the interference of excessive self-consciousness or artificial effort. Like a master musician who no longer thinks about technique or a skilled craftsperson whose hands know exactly what to do, it represents the natural emergence of capability when learned skills become fully integrated and self-consciousness falls away.

In practical expression, it manifests as a kind of enlightened spontaneity - not careless or impulsive action, but rather precisely appropriate response arising naturally from deep understanding and integrated capability. This enables extraordinary effectiveness without strain, authentic expression without self-consciousness, and wise action without hesitation. It represents the culmination of development where effort has transformed into effortless mastery.

This universalized description:
- Preserves the depth of the original Buddhist concept
- Makes it accessible through universal human experiences
- Maintains practical applicability
- Links individual experience to universal principles
- Describes observable manifestations
- Charts a clear developmental trajectory
- Remains philosophically sophisticated while using experiential language

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universalization?
