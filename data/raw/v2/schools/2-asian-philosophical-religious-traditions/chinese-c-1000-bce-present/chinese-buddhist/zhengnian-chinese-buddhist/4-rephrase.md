Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS (Zhengnian):
Core principle: Clear, sustained awareness that bridges formal practice and daily life
Functions: Stabilizing attention, maintaining clarity, integrating practice with activity
Relationships: Foundational for other virtues, supports wisdom development
Developmental: Progresses from intentional to natural awareness

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Present-moment clarity
- Sustained attention
- Mental stability
- Integrated awareness

Contemporary relevance:
- Focus in digital age
- Work-life integration
- Stress management
- Performance enhancement

Here's the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain clear, stable awareness throughout changing circumstances while remaining fully engaged with present experience. This quality combines alert presence with natural ease, allowing simultaneous attention to both immediate details and broader context without strain or fragmentation.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the mind's natural capacity for sustained, clear knowing that transcends the usual distinction between formal practice and everyday activity. It manifests as a unified state where awareness is both focused and spacious, intimate with experience yet unconstrained by it. Rather than a forced state of concentration, it expresses the mind's inherent ability to remain naturally present and engaged while maintaining fundamental clarity and stability.

[Manifestations]
- Sustained attention that doesn't require force or suppress peripheral awareness
- Seamless integration of focused and open awareness
- Natural presence that remains stable across changing circumstances
- Simultaneous attention to detail and context
- Effortless continuity between formal practice and daily activity
- Progressive development from intentional practice to natural expression
- Integration of alertness and relaxation

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by activating and stabilizing the mind's natural capacity for clear knowing, independent of specific objects or conditions. It develops through deliberate practice but matures into an effortless quality that functions automatically, like a well-tuned instrument that maintains its calibration across varied uses. The development follows a trajectory from intentional cultivation to natural expression, eventually becoming an inherent way of being rather than a maintained state.

In practical terms, this quality transforms everyday experience by providing a stable foundation of clarity that enhances all activities while preventing fragmentation and distraction. It enables simultaneous engagement with immediate tasks and broader awareness, allowing for both detailed focus and contextual understanding. This integration supports better decision-making, reduces stress, and facilitates deeper understanding across all life domains.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: ✓ (focuses on universal human capacity for awareness)
2. Preserves depth: ✓ (maintains sophistication while using accessible language)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear connections to daily life and development)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (links personal practice to universal capacity)
5. Developmental clarity: ✓ (shows progression from intentional to natural)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (concrete, verifiable expressions)

The description maintains the essence of Zhengnian while making it accessible and relevant across cultural contexts. It preserves the sophistication of the Buddhist understanding while expressing it in universal terms related to human experience and capacity.
