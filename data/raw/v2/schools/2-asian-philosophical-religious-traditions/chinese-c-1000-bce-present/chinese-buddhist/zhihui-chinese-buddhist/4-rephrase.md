Let me first analyze Zhihui systematically before composing the universal description.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core Principle:
- Transformative understanding that unifies insight and application
- Direct perception of reality combined with skillful engagement
- Integration of ultimate truth with conventional functioning

Key Functions:
1. Illuminates nature of reality
2. Guides skillful action
3. Transforms perception
4. Enables appropriate response
5. Integrates understanding and experience

Relationship Patterns:
- Complements compassion
- Guides skillful means
- Informs ethical behavior
- Enables effective teaching

Developmental Aspects:
- Begins with conceptual understanding
- Deepens through direct experience
- Matures into spontaneous wisdom
- Culminates in natural functioning

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal Human Experiences:
- Moment of profound insight
- Deep understanding beyond concepts
- Integration of knowledge and action
- Clear seeing through confusion
- Natural appropriate response

Now, applying the format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Transformative understanding that combines direct insight into reality with practical wisdom, manifesting as clear perception, appropriate response, and skillful action. This quality integrates deep recognition of fundamental truths with the ability to navigate daily life with discernment and effectiveness.

[Essential Nature]
Transformative understanding operates at multiple levels simultaneously: as direct insight that sees through conceptual overlays to reality itself, as practical wisdom that discerns appropriate action in any situation, and as integrated knowing that bridges universal truth with particular circumstances. Unlike mere intellectual knowledge, this quality fundamentally transforms the knower, naturally expressing itself through clarified perception, spontaneous understanding, and skillful engagement with life.

[Manifestations]
- Clear seeing through habitual patterns and conceptual overlays
- Direct recognition of the nature of experience and phenomena
- Natural appropriate response to circumstances without hesitation
- Skillful navigation of relationships and situations
- Integration of universal principles with particular contexts
- Spontaneous understanding arising without conceptual processing
- Teaching and sharing understanding in ways others can receive

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive refinement of understanding, beginning with conceptual clarity and deepening through direct experience. Initial intellectual comprehension matures through practice into direct perception, while engagement with life circumstances transforms abstract insight into practical wisdom. The process involves both sudden breakthroughs of clarity and gradual integration, each informing and enriching the other.

In practical expression, this understanding manifests as naturally appropriate action, clear discernment in complex situations, and the ability to guide others effectively. It enables one to maintain perspective in challenging circumstances, recognize the core of any situation, and respond with both wisdom and practicality. This quality brings harmony between knowing and doing, understanding and action, universal truth and particular expression.

This universalization maintains the core insights of the Chinese Buddhist concept while making it accessible and relevant across cultural contexts. It preserves the sophistication of the original teaching while expressing it in experiential rather than doctrinal terms.

The description emphasizes:
- The integration of insight and application
- The transformative nature of true understanding
- The practical expression in daily life
- The developmental trajectory from conceptual to direct knowing
- The relationship between universal truth and particular manifestation

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universal description further?
