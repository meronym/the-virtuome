Let me apply this systematic approach to Fangbian (方便):

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Adaptive responsiveness guided by wisdom and care
Key functions: 
- Skillful adjustment of methods
- Meeting others where they are
- Practical effectiveness
- Compassionate strategy
Systemic role: Bridges understanding and application, theory and practice

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Teaching/mentoring relationships
- Problem-solving adaptation
- Communication across differences
- Practical wisdom application

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary pattern: Wisdom expressing through skillful adaptation
Developmental arc: From deliberate strategies to natural responsiveness
Key relationships: Links understanding with action, intention with method

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to respond skillfully to situations and individuals through flexible adaptation of methods, approaches, and expressions while maintaining alignment with deeper principles and beneficial intention. This quality combines practical wisdom, situational awareness, and caring responsiveness to bridge understanding and effective action.

[Essential Nature]
At its heart, this quality represents the sophisticated ability to navigate between universal principles and particular circumstances, manifesting as an intuitive skill in finding the most effective approach in any given situation. It emerges from the integration of deep understanding with practical wisdom, expressing as a dynamic responsiveness that naturally adapts while maintaining integrity with fundamental truths and beneficial aims.

This quality develops through the maturation of both wisdom and compassion, moving from conscious strategic thinking to spontaneous appropriate response. It requires keen perception of both situations and individuals, combined with creative flexibility in approach and expression.

[Manifestations]
- Natural adaptation of communication style to different audiences while preserving essential meaning
- Intuitive selection of methods or approaches based on specific circumstances
- Creative problem-solving that honors both principles and practicality
- Skillful guidance of others that meets them where they are while fostering growth
- Fluid movement between different levels of explanation or engagement
- Spontaneous responsiveness that naturally fits each situation
- Balance between accommodation and maintaining essential truths

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay between deep understanding and practical application, constantly reading situations and adjusting responses accordingly. It involves a sophisticated assessment process that weighs multiple factors - the capacity of others, the demands of circumstances, the core principles at stake, and the most effective means of achievement. This assessment becomes increasingly intuitive with development, eventually operating as spontaneous wisdom-in-action.

In practical expression, this quality manifests as a remarkable effectiveness in teaching, problem-solving, and navigating complex situations. It enables one to bridge different perspectives, find creative solutions to challenging circumstances, and guide others in ways that are both accessible and transformative. The result is an elegant effectiveness that achieves aims while honoring both universal principles and particular contexts.

This universalization preserves the sophisticated nature of Fangbian while making it accessible across cultural contexts. It maintains the depth of the Buddhist understanding while expressing it in terms of universal human experience and practical application. The description emphasizes both the wisdom aspect and the practical effectiveness that characterizes this quality.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
