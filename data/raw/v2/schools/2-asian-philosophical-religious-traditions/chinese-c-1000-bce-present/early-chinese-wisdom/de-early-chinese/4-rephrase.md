Let me work through this systematically for Dé (德).

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Integrative moral-energetic force that manifests as both personal character and natural influence
Key functions: 
- Character cultivation
- Natural influence
- Pattern alignment
- Moral authority
- Social resonance

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Personal growth leading to natural influence
- Character-based leadership
- Authentic moral presence
- Integration of being and doing
- Natural authority through integrity

Here's my attempt at the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The natural force of integrated character that manifests as both inner development and outer influence. It represents the power that emerges when one's way of being aligns with deeper patterns of reality, resulting in effortless moral authority and positive influence on others and environments.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the fundamental connection between personal cultivation and natural influence. It emerges through the progressive integration of character, understanding, and action, manifesting as a kind of moral-energetic presence that naturally influences without forcing. Unlike mere charisma or learned leadership, it reflects an authentic alignment between inner development and universal patterns.

When fully developed, it operates as a field of positive influence, naturally ordering relationships and circumstances around it through its mere presence rather than through deliberate intervention. It combines moral authority with natural effectiveness, personal power with universal alignment.

[Manifestations]
- Effortless positive influence on others and situations
- Natural authority that doesn't rely on position or force
- Authentic presence that inspires trust and respect
- Alignment between inner state and outer effect
- Integration of personal character with natural patterns
- Progressive expansion of positive influence
- Spontaneous ordering effect on environments

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through consistent alignment of thought, feeling, and action with deeper patterns of reality. It begins with conscious cultivation but ultimately becomes natural and spontaneous. The development process involves increasingly subtle recognition of and alignment with fundamental patterns in nature, human relationships, and cosmic order. As integration deepens, influence becomes more effortless and comprehensive.

In practical expression, it manifests as a kind of natural leadership that doesn't depend on position or effort. People and situations naturally organize themselves positively around someone embodying this quality. It creates fields of beneficial influence, improving relationships, environments, and circumstances through its mere presence. The effect is both moral and practical, enhancing both ethical behavior and functional effectiveness in its sphere of influence.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: Yes - describes a universal phenomenon of character-based influence
2. Preservation of depth: Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding of moral-energetic integration
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear manifestations and development path
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - links personal cultivation to universal patterns
5. Development clarity: Yes - describes progression from conscious cultivation to natural emergence
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - effects are concrete and verifiable

The reformulation maintains the sophisticated understanding of dé while making it accessible to those without knowledge of Chinese philosophy. It preserves the integration of moral, energetic, and practical dimensions while expressing them in phenomenological rather than theoretical terms.
