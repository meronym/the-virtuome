[Core Definition]
The capacity for profound attentiveness and appropriate response to genuine value, manifesting as both inner recognition and outer comportment. It combines deep respect with careful attention, enabling proper relationship with whatever holds true significance, whether in nature, human relations, or cosmic order.

[Essential Nature]
Sacred attention is a fundamental human capacity to recognize and properly respond to genuine value and significance. It manifests as a distinctive quality of awareness that combines careful attention with deep respect, creating both internal orientation and external comportment appropriate to what is encountered. This quality enables direct recognition of profound value while maintaining the appropriate psychological and behavioral distance that allows this value to be fully appreciated and properly engaged with.

This attentive reverence operates as a protective and enhancing force, preserving both the dignity of what is encountered and the integrity of the one encountering it. It creates the conditions for genuine relationship with significance while preventing the distortions that come from either over-familiarity or dismissive distance.

[Functional Description]
Sacred attention develops through repeated encounter with genuine value and significance, combined with guidance in appropriate recognition and response. It begins with learning proper external forms but gradually develops into natural, spontaneous recognition and response. This capacity grows through practice in maintaining the delicate balance between distance and intimacy that allows profound value to be fully appreciated while preventing its distortion through either over-familiarity or dismissive distance.

In practical expression, this quality manifests as a natural dignity and appropriateness in speech, behavior, and relationship. It enables recognition of what truly matters in any situation and guides appropriate response, whether in human relationships, professional conduct, or engagement with nature and cosmic order. This creates the conditions for genuine depth in relationships and activities while protecting against superficiality and inappropriate conduct.
