Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Jìng (敬):
Core principle: Attentive reverence/sacred attention
Key functions: 
- Creates proper inner attitude
- Guides external comportment
- Facilitates recognition of significance
- Enables appropriate response to value
- Maintains proper relationships

Universal experiences it relates to:
- Encounter with greatness/profundity
- Recognition of deep value
- Experience of the sacred
- Awareness of significance
- Careful attention to importance

Here's my attempt at the universal language transformation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for profound attentiveness and appropriate response to genuine value, manifesting as both inner recognition and outer comportment. It combines deep respect with careful attention, enabling proper relationship with whatever holds true significance, whether in nature, human relations, or cosmic order.

[Essential Nature]
Sacred attention is a fundamental human capacity to recognize and properly respond to genuine value and significance. It manifests as a distinctive quality of awareness that combines careful attention with deep respect, creating both internal orientation and external comportment appropriate to what is encountered. This quality enables direct recognition of profound value while maintaining the appropriate psychological and behavioral distance that allows this value to be fully appreciated and properly engaged with.

This attentive reverence operates as a protective and enhancing force, preserving both the dignity of what is encountered and the integrity of the one encountering it. It creates the conditions for genuine relationship with significance while preventing the distortions that come from either over-familiarity or dismissive distance.

[Manifestations]
- Careful, focused attention to what holds genuine significance
- Appropriate psychological and physical distance in relationships
- Measured, considered speech and action in important matters
- Recognition and protection of authentic value
- Natural gravity and dignity in bearing and behavior
- Spontaneous respect response to encountered greatness
- Capacity to maintain proper relationship with profound reality

[Functional Description]
Sacred attention develops through repeated encounter with genuine value and significance, combined with guidance in appropriate recognition and response. It begins with learning proper external forms but gradually develops into natural, spontaneous recognition and response. This capacity grows through practice in maintaining the delicate balance between distance and intimacy that allows profound value to be fully appreciated while preventing its distortion through either over-familiarity or dismissive distance.

In practical expression, this quality manifests as a natural dignity and appropriateness in speech, behavior, and relationship. It enables recognition of what truly matters in any situation and guides appropriate response, whether in human relationships, professional conduct, or engagement with nature and cosmic order. This creates the conditions for genuine depth in relationships and activities while protecting against superficiality and inappropriate conduct.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Yes - focuses on universal human experience of encountering significance
2. Preserves depth: Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding of proper relationship to value
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear manifestations and development path
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - links personal capacity to universal significance
5. Development clarity: Yes - shows progression from external forms to internal recognition
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - all listed manifestations are concrete and verifiable

The transformation maintains the sophistication of the original Chinese concept while making it accessible through universal human experience of encountering and relating to significance. It preserves the practical wisdom about proper relationship to value while removing culture-specific references.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this transformation?
