Let me follow the analytical process step by step:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Xìn (信):
Core principle: Alignment between internal commitment and external action
Key functions:
- Creates social trust
- Enables reliable relationships
- Builds credible reputation
- Maintains social order
Systemic role: Foundation for all sustainable relationships and social coordination

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Promise-keeping and breaking
- Building/losing trust
- Reputation development
- Reliable vs unreliable relationships
Contemporary parallels:
- Professional integrity
- Brand trust
- Social capital
- Contractual reliability

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Internal-external coherence
- Consistent behavior patterns
- Trust development cycles
- Relationship stability

Secondary:
- Short-term vs long-term tensions
- Trust recovery processes
- Reputation management
- Social network effects

Based on this analysis, here's the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of demonstrating reliable coherence between declared intentions and actual behavior, creating a foundation of trust through consistent alignment of words and actions. This alignment generates social trust, enables sustainable relationships, and creates the conditions for cooperative human endeavors.

[Essential Nature]
At its core, this quality represents the bridge between internal commitment and external manifestation - the capacity to maintain consistent alignment between what we say and what we do. It operates as a fundamental force of social cohesion by creating predictability and reliability in human interactions. More than simple honesty or reliability, it embodies the active cultivation of trustworthiness through demonstrated consistency over time.

This quality emerges from the recognition that sustainable human cooperation requires a foundation of predictable behavior and reliable commitments. It represents the behavioral infrastructure that enables increasingly complex forms of human collaboration and relationship.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent follow-through on stated intentions and promises
- Gradual building of reputation through repeated reliable actions
- Maintenance of commitments even when personally costly
- Clear communication of intentions and limitations
- Active management of others' reasonable expectations
- Development of deep trust through long-term behavioral consistency
- Capacity to rebuild trust through transparent accountability

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through an iterative process of making and keeping commitments, starting with small promises and progressively building to more significant responsibilities. Each aligned action strengthens the internal capacity for consistency while simultaneously building external social trust. The quality operates as a self-reinforcing cycle: demonstrated reliability creates opportunities for more significant commitments, which when fulfilled further strengthen both capability and reputation.

In practical terms, this quality manifests as a reliable pattern of behavior that others can confidently predict and depend upon. It creates efficiency in social interactions by reducing the need for constant verification and enabling more complex forms of cooperation. While initially requiring conscious effort to maintain alignment between words and actions, it eventually becomes an integrated characteristic that naturally generates trust and enables deeper relationships.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the core Chinese concept of internal-external alignment
2. Makes it accessible across cultures
3. Maintains sophistication while using clear language
4. Links individual behavior to social impact
5. Shows clear development pathway
6. Provides observable criteria
7. Maintains practical relevance
