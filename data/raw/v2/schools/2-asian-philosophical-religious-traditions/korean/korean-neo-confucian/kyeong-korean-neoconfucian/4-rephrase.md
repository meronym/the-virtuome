Let me work through this systematically for Gyeong (경/敬).

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Sustained attentive presence combining reverence and mindful awareness
Functions: Mental composure, focused attention, quality of engagement
Systemic role: Methodological foundation for development of other virtues
Developmental aspects: Progressive refinement of attention and presence

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- The quality of mind when fully absorbed in meaningful activity
- The natural reverence felt in profound moments
- The clarity that comes with full presence
- The difference between mechanical and mindful action

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Sustained attention with reverence
- Integration of respect and awareness
- Quality of engagement with reality
- Foundation for authentic development

Secondary:
- Scattered attention as main obstacle
- Cultivation through practice
- Supports all other virtues
- Both method and outcome

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of sustained, reverent attention that combines full presence with deep respect. It manifests as a refined way of engaging with reality that unites careful attention, genuine respect, and complete presence in both thought and action. This quality serves as both a method of development and its natural fruition.

[Essential Nature]
Reverent attention represents a fundamental shift in how we relate to experience - from casual or mechanical engagement to one characterized by full presence and natural respect. It's not merely paying attention, but rather a quality of mind that unifies alertness with reverence, creating a stable foundation for authentic development and understanding. This quality brings dignity to ordinary activities while enabling deeper insight and more genuine relationships.

[Manifestations]
- Natural dignity and composure in action and bearing
- Sustained, effortless attention in activities and interactions
- Genuine respect that arises from deep presence rather than convention
- Integration of careful precision with natural ease
- The subtle shift from mechanical to mindful engagement
- Progressive refinement of awareness in both ordinary and significant moments
- Visible quality of authenticity in relationships and activities

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive refinement of attention, starting with deliberate practice in specific situations and gradually becoming a natural way of being. It begins with conscious effort to maintain presence and respect, but through consistent cultivation becomes an effortless quality that permeates all activity. The development involves recognizing and working with the mind's tendency toward scattered attention and mechanical action.

In practical expression, reverent attention transforms every aspect of life by bringing depth and authenticity to ordinary activities. It manifests as natural dignity in bearing, genuine care in relationships, and absorbed presence in work. This quality creates a foundation for deeper understanding and more authentic engagement with life, while naturally elevating the quality of all other virtues through its underlying influence on how we engage with experience.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the core meaning of gyeong
2. Makes it accessible across cultures
3. Maintains practical applicability
4. Connects individual practice to universal principles
5. Describes observable manifestations
6. Retains sophistication while using experiential language

The description emphasizes phenomenological aspects over cultural specifics while preserving the depth and practical significance of the original concept. It connects to universal human experiences while maintaining the precision and sophistication of the Neo-Confucian understanding.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
