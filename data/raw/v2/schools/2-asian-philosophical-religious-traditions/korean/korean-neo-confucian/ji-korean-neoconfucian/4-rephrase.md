Let me work through this systematically for Ji (지/智).

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Integration of moral understanding with practical judgment
Key functions:
- Discernment of right action
- Integration of knowledge and practice
- Ethical decision-making capacity
- Recognition of underlying principles
- Application of moral understanding

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Making difficult decisions
- Understanding complex situations
- Applying knowledge effectively
- Developing good judgment
- Growing in understanding through experience

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary:
- Discriminating understanding
- Practical wisdom in action
- Progressive development through experience
- Integration with other virtues

Secondary:
- Challenge of bias/prejudice
- Need for continuous learning
- Relationship to emotional intelligence
- Real-world application

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to deeply understand situations and act with discerning wisdom, combining clear perception with practical judgment. It manifests as the ability to recognize what truly matters in any situation and respond appropriately, integrating knowledge with action through mature understanding.

[Essential Nature]
Wisdom emerges as the natural integration of deep understanding with practical judgment. It goes beyond mere knowledge or intelligence, representing a mature capacity to perceive the essential nature of situations and respond appropriately. This quality combines clarity of perception with depth of understanding, enabling one to recognize underlying patterns and principles while maintaining practical effectiveness.

Unlike pure intellectual ability, this wisdom embodies the marriage of understanding with ethical discernment, resulting in consistently sound judgment that serves both individual and collective wellbeing.

[Manifestations]
- Clear discernment in complex situations
- Balanced judgment that considers multiple perspectives
- Practical effectiveness guided by deeper understanding
- Natural integration of knowledge with action
- Recognition of what truly matters in any situation
- Ability to see both details and larger patterns
- Consistent good judgment that benefits self and others

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive integration of experience with understanding. It begins with basic discernment and grows through repeated exposure to varied situations, reflection on experience, and the cultivation of deeper insight. The process involves both learning from direct experience and absorbing wisdom from others, gradually building a comprehensive capacity for understanding and effective action.

In practical terms, it manifests as naturally good judgment that doesn't require lengthy deliberation. Those who embody this quality demonstrate an immediate grasp of situations and respond appropriately without forced calculation. Their actions show a natural alignment with what's truly important, benefiting themselves and others through consistently wise choices and behaviors.

This universalized description aims to:
1. Capture the essence of Ji without relying on culture-specific concepts
2. Connect it to universal human experiences of developing wisdom
3. Maintain the sophistication of the original concept
4. Make it practically applicable across contexts
5. Preserve the developmental aspects
6. Keep the integration of understanding and action central

The description emphasizes the practical, experiential aspects while maintaining the depth of the original Korean Neo-Confucian concept. It avoids technical philosophical language while preserving the sophisticated understanding of how wisdom functions and develops.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect to better meet the objectives?
