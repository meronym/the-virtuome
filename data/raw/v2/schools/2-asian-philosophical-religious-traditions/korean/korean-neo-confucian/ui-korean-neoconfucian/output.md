[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a progression from conscious rule-following to intuitive moral wisdom. It begins with learning ethical principles and practicing deliberate choice-making, gradually becoming internalized as direct moral perception and natural righteous action. The development requires both intellectual understanding and practical experience, strengthened through facing and resolving real ethical challenges.

It enables one to navigate complex ethical situations with clarity and wisdom, maintaining integrity while adapting to circumstances. This quality earns the natural respect of others and contributes to the moral fabric of community life, serving as a stabilizing force in social relationships and institutions.
