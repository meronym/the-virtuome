Let me follow the process systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Ui (의/義):
Core principle: Moral discernment and righteous action alignment
Key functions: 
- Distinguishing right from wrong
- Motivating principled action
- Guiding social conduct
- Balancing competing obligations
Systemic role: Bridge between moral knowledge and action
Developmental aspects: Progresses from rule-following to intuitive wisdom

2. UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Moral decision-making moments
- Ethical dilemmas
- Standing up for principles
- Choosing right over expedient
Contemporary applications:
- Professional ethics
- Social justice
- Personal integrity
- Civic responsibility

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Primary Elements:
- Moral discernment capacity
- Principled action
- Integration of knowledge and behavior
- Social responsibility
Secondary Elements:
- Internal-external alignment
- Courage to act rightly
- Practical wisdom
- Community impact

Here's the universalized description following the requested format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to discern what is fundamentally right and the commitment to align one's actions with this understanding, even when challenging or costly. It manifests as the integration of moral clarity, principled action, and practical wisdom in navigating life's ethical dimensions.

[Essential Nature]
Righteousness represents the human capacity to recognize and respond to moral truth beyond mere social conventions or personal advantage. It operates as both an perceptive faculty - allowing us to distinguish right from wrong - and an active force that compels us to embody our highest understanding through concrete actions. This quality bridges our moral knowledge with our behavior, transforming abstract principles into lived reality.

[Manifestations]
- Clear discernment between right and wrong in complex situations
- Courage to stand by principles despite personal cost
- Consistent alignment between stated values and actual behavior
- Natural authority that comes from moral integrity
- Practical wisdom in applying principles to real situations
- Positive influence on others through exemplary conduct
- Balance between justice and compassion in dealing with others

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a progression from conscious rule-following to intuitive moral wisdom. It begins with learning ethical principles and practicing deliberate choice-making, gradually becoming internalized as direct moral perception and natural righteous action. The development requires both intellectual understanding and practical experience, strengthened through facing and resolving real ethical challenges.

In practice, it manifests as a reliable moral compass that guides decision-making and behavior across all life domains. It enables one to navigate complex ethical situations with clarity and wisdom, maintaining integrity while adapting to circumstances. This quality earns the natural respect of others and contributes to the moral fabric of community life, serving as a stabilizing force in social relationships and institutions.
```

This universalized description aims to:
- Capture the essence of Ui while making it accessible
- Preserve its sophistication while using relatable language
- Connect individual development to social impact
- Emphasize both perceptive and active aspects
- Maintain practical applicability
- Highlight universal human experiences
- Show clear developmental trajectory

The description should resonate across cultures while maintaining the depth and practical wisdom of the original Korean Neo-Confucian concept. It connects personal moral development with broader social responsibility, and provides clear markers for both understanding and cultivation of this quality.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
