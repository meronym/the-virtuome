Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF JUNG (중/中):
Core principle: Dynamic equilibrium and situational appropriateness
Key functions: 
- Harmonizing opposing forces
- Finding optimal response
- Maintaining sustainable balance
- Regulating extremes

Universal experiences:
- Navigating competing demands
- Finding sustainable rhythms
- Adjusting to changing circumstances
- Maintaining stability amid change

Here's my attempt at a universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to find and maintain dynamic equilibrium in all aspects of life, manifesting as the ability to respond to situations with appropriate measure, neither exceeding nor falling short of what circumstances require. It represents active harmony rather than passive compromise, integrating rather than averaging extremes.

[Essential Nature]
Dynamic equilibrium differs fundamentally from simple moderation or compromise. It represents an active capacity to find the optimal point of harmony unique to each situation, relationship, or challenge. Like a skilled acrobat maintaining balance through constant micro-adjustments, this quality enables one to respond to life's changing circumstances with precision and appropriateness.

This balance isn't static but continuously adapts, integrating opposing forces and requirements into a sustainable whole. It manifests as both an internal state of emotional-mental equilibrium and an external capacity for appropriate action.

[Manifestations]
- Emotional regulation that matches situational needs
- Decision-making that integrates multiple valid considerations
- Social interactions calibrated to relationship and context
- Resource management that balances conservation and use
- Physical action that employs appropriate force and timing
- Speech that is neither overly reserved nor excessive
- Leadership that harmonizes structure and flexibility

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through continuous awareness and responsive adjustment, like an internal compass that senses when we're veering toward excess or deficiency in any dimension. It develops through repeated experience of finding optimal points between extremes, gradually building an intuitive sense of appropriateness that can respond to novel situations. The process involves both analytical understanding and embodied wisdom.

In practical application, it enables sustainable high performance in any domain by preventing the wear and depletion that comes from excess, while avoiding the stagnation that results from insufficiency. This creates resilience and longevity in relationships, projects, and personal development. Rather than settling for compromise, it finds creative solutions that honor all valid demands of a situation.
```

This universalization attempts to:
- Preserve the sophisticated understanding of balance from Neo-Confucian thought
- Make it accessible through physical/experiential metaphors
- Maintain practical applicability
- Connect individual practice to universal principles
- Show clear development pathway
- Provide observable manifestations

The description emphasizes that this isn't simple moderation but a dynamic, skilled capacity that creates optimal outcomes through appropriate response. It preserves the depth of the original concept while making it accessible to contemporary understanding.

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universalization further?
