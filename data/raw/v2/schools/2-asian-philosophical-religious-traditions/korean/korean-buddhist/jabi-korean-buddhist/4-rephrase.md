Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF JABI:
Core principle: Integration of emotional warmth with clear understanding
Functions: Guides action, transforms perception, connects beings
Manifestations: Care, support, insight, engagement
Systemic role: Bridges wisdom and action, self and other

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Recognition of shared vulnerability
- Impulse to alleviate suffering
- Connection through understanding
- Wise care in action

STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Fusion of heart and mind
- Active care informed by understanding
- Progressive development from self to universal
- Integration of emotion and wisdom

Secondary:
- Obstacle: Emotional reactivity vs. detachment
- Support: Understanding interconnection
- Related: Wisdom, empathy, care
- Applications: Relationships, service, conflict

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to combine deep understanding with heartfelt care, expressing itself as wise, active compassion. It represents the natural fusion of emotional warmth with clear insight, manifesting as appropriate, skillful response to suffering and need. This quality develops through progressive integration of understanding and feeling.

[Essential Nature]
This quality emerges from the intersection of two fundamental human capacities: the ability to understand deeply and the ability to care deeply. Unlike pure emotional empathy or abstract understanding alone, it represents their mature integration. It functions as a dynamic bridge between wisdom and action, transforming both the one who embodies it and those who receive its expression.

The quality develops through expanding circles of understanding and connection, beginning with immediate empathy and gradually maturing into universal care guided by wisdom. This development involves both heart and mind, leading to increasingly sophisticated and natural expressions of compassionate action.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous recognition of and response to suffering
- Balanced engagement that neither overwhelms nor distances
- Appropriate scaling of care from individual to systemic levels
- Wise discernment in how to help effectively
- Integration of emotional warmth with clear understanding
- Active engagement that addresses root causes and immediate needs
- Natural expression of care that enriches rather than depletes

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous feedback loop between understanding and feeling. As understanding deepens, emotional responses become more refined and appropriate; as emotional connection develops, understanding becomes more direct and profound. This integration enables increasingly sophisticated responses to complex situations while maintaining genuine warmth and connection.

In practical expression, it manifests as the ability to respond to suffering and need with both immediacy and wisdom. Actions emerge naturally from deep understanding rather than mere reaction, leading to interventions that address both immediate concerns and underlying causes. This quality enables sustainable care that neither burns out nor becomes detached, maintaining effectiveness through wisdom while preserving genuine emotional connection.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Yes - based on universal human capacities
2. Preserves depth: Yes - maintains sophisticated integration aspects
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear manifestations and development path
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - shows progressive development
5. Development clarity: Yes - describes maturation process
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - concrete expressions listed

This universalized description maintains the sophisticated integration central to Jabi while making it accessible through universal human experiences and observable manifestations. It preserves the depth of the Korean Buddhist understanding while expressing it in terms that can be understood and applied across cultural contexts.
