Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS (Viriya):
- Core principle: Sustained, balanced engagement/effort
- Key functions: Enables persistence, overcomes inertia, maintains momentum
- Systemic role: Powers development, enables other virtues
- Developmental aspects: From gross to subtle, from forced to natural

UNIVERSALIZATION:
- Universal experiences: Motivation, persistence, commitment, energy management
- Parallel concepts: Grit, resilience, perseverance, determined effort
- Contemporary relevance: Goal achievement, personal development, professional excellence
- Timeless patterns: Balance, sustainability, intelligent application of force

Here's my attempt at the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for sustained, intelligent engagement that combines enthusiasm with persistence. It manifests as the ability to maintain consistent effort toward worthy aims while skillfully managing one's energy and avoiding both over-exertion and complacency.

[Essential Nature]
Sustained engagement represents a dynamic balance between active force and intelligent restraint. Unlike mere persistence or raw determination, it embodies a sophisticated understanding of effort that recognizes the importance of rhythm, sustainability, and appropriate application of energy. It combines the warmth of enthusiasm with the stability of commitment, operating through both active phases of intense engagement and receptive phases of restoration and integration.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent application of effort despite obstacles or fluctuating conditions
- Natural enthusiasm that refreshes itself through engaged activity
- Skillful alternation between intensity and recovery
- Capacity to maintain long-term commitments without burnout
- Ability to adjust effort according to circumstances while maintaining direction
- Development of momentum that becomes increasingly self-sustaining
- Integration of activity and rest into a sustainable rhythm

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by establishing a dynamic equilibrium between opposing forces: effort and ease, engagement and recovery, persistence and flexibility. It develops through progressive refinement of one's relationship with effort, moving from crude pushing to sophisticated engagement. The initial stages often require conscious application of force, but with maturation, it evolves toward a more natural, self-sustaining momentum.

In practical expression, it manifests as the ability to stay committed to long-term goals while maintaining freshness and enthusiasm. It enables both the intensity needed for breakthrough moments and the consistency required for lasting change. This quality transforms the experience of effort from one of strain and struggle to one of engaged flow, where persistence becomes natural and sustainable rather than forced.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: ✓ (Uses universal human experiences of effort/energy)
2. Preservation of depth: ✓ (Maintains sophisticated understanding of effort)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (Clear applications in various contexts)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (Links personal effort to universal patterns)
5. Development clarity: ✓ (Shows progression from gross to subtle)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (Clear behavioral/experiential markers)

Would you like me to revise any aspect or elaborate on specific elements?
