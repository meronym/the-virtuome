[Core Definition]
The innate human capacity for extending genuine goodwill and benevolence toward all beings, including oneself. This quality manifests as a warm-hearted interest in wellbeing, transcending personal preferences or conditions, and naturally dissolving barriers between self and others through recognition of fundamental connectedness.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the mind and heart's natural ability to resonate with the desire for wellbeing, beginning with oneself and progressively expanding to encompass all life. Unlike selective forms of love or affection, it operates as a universal force that recognizes the shared nature of human experience and responds with unconditional goodwill. It functions both as an immediate emotional quality and as a cultivated understanding that develops through intentional practice.

Rather than being merely an emotional state, it represents a fundamental recognition of interconnectedness and shared humanity that manifests as active well-wishing and genuine care for the happiness of all beings. This quality serves as the foundation for deeper forms of compassion and empathetic action.

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by activating and strengthening the mind's natural capacity for positive connection and well-wishing. It begins with recognizing and resonating with the universal desire for happiness and wellbeing, first in oneself and then in others. As it develops, it progressively dissolves the habitual barriers that separate self from others, transforming our fundamental relationship with experience from one of division to one of connection.

In practical terms, this quality expresses itself through genuine warmth in interactions, spontaneous wishes for others' wellbeing, and a natural inclination toward inclusive rather than exclusive thinking. It manifests in daily life as increased patience in difficult situations, greater ease in social interactions, and a growing ability to maintain positive intention even under challenging circumstances. This creates a foundation for more harmonious relationships and contributes to both personal wellbeing and social cohesion.
