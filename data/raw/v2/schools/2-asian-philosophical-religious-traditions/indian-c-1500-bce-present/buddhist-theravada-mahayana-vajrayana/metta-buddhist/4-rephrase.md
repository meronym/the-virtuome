Let me analyze and transform the concept of Mettā following our framework.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Universal, unconditional goodwill
Key functions: Heart-opening, barrier-dissolving, connection-building
Systemic role: Foundation for compassion, basis for social harmony
Developmental: Progresses from self to close others to all beings

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences: Care, warmth, friendliness, connection
Parallel concepts: Goodwill, benevolence, universal love, well-wishing
Contemporary relevance: Social connection, conflict resolution, mental health
Timeless patterns: Expansion of care, dissolution of boundaries

Here's the universal language transformation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The innate human capacity for extending genuine goodwill and benevolence toward all beings, including oneself. This quality manifests as a warm-hearted interest in wellbeing, transcending personal preferences or conditions, and naturally dissolving barriers between self and others through recognition of fundamental connectedness.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the mind and heart's natural ability to resonate with the desire for wellbeing, beginning with oneself and progressively expanding to encompass all life. Unlike selective forms of love or affection, it operates as a universal force that recognizes the shared nature of human experience and responds with unconditional goodwill. It functions both as an immediate emotional quality and as a cultivated understanding that develops through intentional practice.

Rather than being merely an emotional state, it represents a fundamental recognition of interconnectedness and shared humanity that manifests as active well-wishing and genuine care for the happiness of all beings. This quality serves as the foundation for deeper forms of compassion and empathetic action.

[Manifestations]
- Genuine warmth and friendliness in interpersonal interactions
- Spontaneous well-wishing for others' happiness, including strangers
- Reduction in reactive judgments and automatic aversion
- Growing sense of connection with increasingly diverse groups
- Natural inclusion of self in the sphere of care and goodwill
- Ability to maintain positive intention even in difficult circumstances
- Progressive dissolution of artificial boundaries between self and others

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by activating and strengthening the mind's natural capacity for positive connection and well-wishing. It begins with recognizing and resonating with the universal desire for happiness and wellbeing, first in oneself and then in others. As it develops, it progressively dissolves the habitual barriers that separate self from others, transforming our fundamental relationship with experience from one of division to one of connection.

In practical terms, this quality expresses itself through genuine warmth in interactions, spontaneous wishes for others' wellbeing, and a natural inclination toward inclusive rather than exclusive thinking. It manifests in daily life as increased patience in difficult situations, greater ease in social interactions, and a growing ability to maintain positive intention even under challenging circumstances. This creates a foundation for more harmonious relationships and contributes to both personal wellbeing and social cohesion.

This transformation aims to:
1. Preserve the depth of mettā while making it accessible
2. Connect it to universal human experience
3. Maintain its systematic developmental aspects
4. Highlight practical applications
5. Retain its sophisticated understanding of mind and heart
6. Make it verifiable through direct experience

The description avoids:
- Buddhist-specific terminology
- Cultural-specific references
- Abstract theoretical frameworks
- Religious or spiritual claims

While maintaining:
- Practical applicability
- Developmental progression
- Systematic understanding
- Experiential verifiability

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this transformation or explain my reasoning for specific choices?
