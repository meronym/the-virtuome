Let me work through this systematically for Karuṇā.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Responsive awareness of and engagement with suffering
Functions: Recognition, resonance, response, relief
System role: Motivating force, balancing factor, wisdom companion
Development: From personal empathy to universal care

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences: Recognition of pain, desire to help, protective instinct
Parallel concepts: Empathy, caring response, active concern
Contemporary relevance: Healthcare, social justice, conflict resolution
Timeless patterns: Recognition-Response-Action cycle

Here's my attempt at the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize suffering in all its forms, coupled with the spontaneous impulse and sustained commitment to engage in its relief. This quality combines clear perception, emotional resonance, and practical response, manifesting as both immediate care and long-term dedication to reducing harm and promoting wellbeing.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the maturation of natural human empathy into a stable, universal response pattern. It begins with the clear recognition of suffering - from obvious physical pain to subtle forms of existential distress. This recognition naturally awakens resonance, but without becoming overwhelmed by it. Instead, it channels emotional connection into practical response, maintaining engagement while avoiding burnout.

The quality develops through expanding circles of concern, eventually transcending personal preferences and cultural boundaries. It combines warmth with wisdom, engagement with equipoise, acting as both motivating force and guiding principle in human development.

[Manifestations]
- Immediate recognition of suffering in its varied forms
- Balanced emotional resonance without overwhelming distress
- Spontaneous impulse to help coupled with practical judgment
- Sustained engagement in relief of suffering
- Ability to remain present with pain while maintaining effectiveness
- Progressive expansion from personal to universal concern
- Integration of emotional warmth with clear understanding

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a three-fold process: recognition, resonance, and response. Recognition involves both cognitive and intuitive awareness of suffering in its many forms. Resonance creates emotional connection without overwhelm, maintaining enough distance for effective action while preserving genuine concern. Response emerges naturally from this balanced awareness, manifesting as both immediate aid and long-term committed action.

In practical terms, this quality transforms natural human empathy into reliable, sustainable care. It prevents both emotional exhaustion and detached indifference by fostering balanced engagement. This enables consistent, effective action in challenging situations while supporting personal growth through expanding circles of concern and deepening understanding of human experience.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural? Yes - based on universal human experiences
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while being accessible
3. Practical? Yes - clear manifestations and development path
4. Individual-Universal connection? Yes - shows development from personal to universal
5. Development clear? Yes - describes progression and maturation
6. Observable? Yes - concrete manifestations listed

The description aims to capture the essence of Karuṇā while making it accessible and relevant to contemporary contexts, maintaining both its profound depth and practical applicability. It avoids Buddhist-specific terminology while preserving the sophisticated understanding of how this quality functions and develops.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect to better meet the objectives?
