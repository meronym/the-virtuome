Let me follow the process systematically for Paññā.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Deep experiential understanding of reality's nature
Key functions:
- Penetrative discernment
- Reality recognition
- Pattern recognition
- Transformative insight
- Integration of understanding

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Moments of profound realization
- Pattern recognition across contexts
- Deep intuitive understanding
- Transformative insights
- Integration of experience

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary patterns:
- Progressive deepening
- Iterative development
- Experiential verification
- Practical application

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Penetrative understanding that sees through surface appearances to recognize deeper patterns of reality, combining analytical clarity with intuitive depth to transform how we experience and engage with life. This quality develops through direct investigation of experience, leading to increasingly subtle recognition of fundamental patterns and principles.

[Essential Nature]
Deep understanding represents the mind's capacity to penetrate beyond conceptual knowledge to direct recognition of how things actually are. It combines sharp discernment with profound comprehension, operating at multiple levels simultaneously: careful observation of details, recognition of patterns and relationships, and intuitive grasp of fundamental principles.

This quality emerges through the marriage of careful investigation with open receptivity, developing through stages from intellectual comprehension to direct experiential understanding to transformative realization. It brings clarity to complexity while revealing the simple patterns underlying apparent chaos.

[Manifestations]
- Clear recognition of patterns and relationships in complex situations
- Capacity to distinguish genuine from artificial, essential from superficial
- Direct insight into causal connections and systemic relationships
- Integration of analytical and intuitive understanding
- Translation of understanding into wise action
- Progressive refinement of perception and comprehension
- Ability to recognize same principles across different contexts

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through careful attention to direct experience, gradually refining our capacity to see clearly and understand deeply. It begins with careful observation and analysis but matures into direct recognition that operates prior to conceptual thought. As understanding deepens, it naturally integrates multiple perspectives and levels of comprehension, seeing both details and wholeness simultaneously.

In practical application, this quality manifests as clarity in decision-making, wisdom in relationships, and skillful navigation of complex situations. It enables one to recognize underlying patterns in seemingly different situations, understand systemic relationships, and respond appropriately to changing circumstances. This understanding naturally expresses itself in more effective action and greater harmony with reality's fundamental nature.

This universalized description aims to:
- Capture the transformative depth of paññā without Buddhist-specific terminology
- Maintain the sophistication of the concept while making it accessible
- Connect individual experience to universal patterns
- Preserve the developmental and practical aspects
- Make the quality recognizable and applicable across contexts

The description emphasizes:
- Experiential rather than theoretical understanding
- Progressive development through practice
- Multiple levels of operation
- Practical manifestation and application
- Universal human capacity for deep understanding

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: Uses universal human experiences of understanding
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language
3. Practical applicability: Clear connections to daily life and decision-making
4. Individual-universal connection: Links personal development to universal patterns
5. Developmental clarity: Shows progression from basic to profound understanding
6. Observable manifestations: Concrete, verifiable expressions of the quality

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
