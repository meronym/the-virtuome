Let me follow the process systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS - Karma Yoga:
Core principle: Integration of action and awareness
Key functions: 
- Transforms ordinary action into spiritual practice
- Resolves action-contemplation dichotomy
- Develops non-attachment while maintaining full engagement
- Purifies motivation and intention

Systemic role:
- Bridges inner development and outer action
- Connects individual effort to universal purpose
- Integrates personal duty with transpersonal development

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Work and its meaning
- Effort and results relationship
- Motivation and intention
- Attention and engagement
- Personal vs collective purpose

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The art of integrated action - a way of engaging in activity that unifies attention, intention, and execution while transcending self-centered motivation. It represents the transformation of necessary action into a vehicle for human development through the cultivation of skill, awareness, and selfless dedication.

[Essential Nature]
At its heart, this quality represents the resolution of the seeming contradiction between active engagement and inner freedom. It operates through the progressive refinement of action, attention, and intention - transforming routine activities into opportunities for development through the cultivation of present-moment awareness, skillful execution, and dedication beyond personal gain.

This quality manifests as a distinct way of engaging with activity where the usual tension between achieving results and maintaining inner peace dissolves. It develops through the systematic integration of complete attention to the present task, detachment from personal outcomes, and dedication to excellence in execution.

[Manifestations]
- Absorbed attention: Complete focus on the present activity without psychological distraction
- Skillful execution: Maximum competence in action combined with minimum ego involvement
- Result neutrality: Equal engagement regardless of personal success or failure
- Service orientation: Action performed for its inherent value rather than personal gain
- Present-moment integration: Unification of awareness and action in each moment
- Excellence without attachment: Highest standards of performance without psychological dependency
- Collective benefit focus: Action oriented toward universal rather than merely personal good

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a progressive refinement of attention and intention in action. It begins with conscious effort to maintain present-moment awareness during activity, evolves through the cultivation of skill and dedication, and matures into a natural state of absorbed, selfless engagement. The process involves simultaneously developing technical excellence and psychological freedom, transforming ordinary activities into opportunities for deeper human development.

In practical application, this quality manifests as a distinct way of working and acting that combines full engagement with inner freedom. It enables high performance without stress, excellence without ego, and achievement without attachment. This approach resolves common workplace challenges like motivation, burnout, and work-life balance by transforming the very nature of how we engage with activity. The result is action that serves both practical achievement and personal development, benefiting both individual and collective welfare.
