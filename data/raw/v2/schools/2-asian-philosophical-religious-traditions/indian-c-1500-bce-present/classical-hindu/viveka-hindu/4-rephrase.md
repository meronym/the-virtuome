Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS FOR VIVEKA:
- Core principle: Discernment/discrimination between real/unreal
- Key functions: Clarity, wisdom, insight, understanding
- Systemic role: Foundation for wisdom-based action
- Developmental: Progresses from gross to subtle discrimination

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
- Universal experiences: Decision-making, clarity, insight moments
- Parallel concepts: Wisdom, discernment, clear seeing, understanding
- Contemporary relevance: Critical thinking, decision-making, authenticity
- Timeless patterns: Progressive refinement of understanding

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for clear discernment that distinguishes essential from non-essential, enabling precise understanding and wise action. It manifests as an increasingly refined ability to perceive truth directly, operating through both analytical and intuitive channels to reveal the genuine nature of reality, experience, and phenomena.

[Essential Nature]
Discernment functions as an internal compass that navigates between surface appearances and deeper truths. It combines intellectual precision with intuitive insight, developing through progressive stages of refinement. Initially operating in obvious distinctions, it gradually evolves to perceive increasingly subtle layers of reality and experience. This quality acts as both a diagnostic tool for understanding and a transformative force that clarifies perception and purifies understanding.

More than mere intellectual analysis, it represents the mind's natural capacity to recognize truth when presented with mixed or conflicting information. It serves as the bridge between knowledge and wisdom, transforming information into understanding and understanding into insight.

[Manifestations]
- Clarity in decision-making and choice
- Recognition of authentic vs inauthentic in experience
- Ability to separate essential from non-essential
- Progressive refinement of understanding
- Direct perception of truth beneath appearances
- Integration of analytical and intuitive knowing
- Natural wisdom in action and response

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dual process of elimination and recognition. The discriminative faculty first separates mixed elements of experience, like a prism separating light into its component colors. It then recognizes the essential nature of each element through direct perception rather than conceptual analysis. This process becomes increasingly refined and immediate with development, eventually operating as spontaneous understanding.

In practical application, it manifests as clear judgment in complex situations, wisdom in personal choices, and authentic understanding in learning and experience. It naturally guides action toward what is genuine and essential while moving away from the superficial and misleading. This faculty develops through conscious exercise in daily choices and deepens through reflection on experience, gradually maturing into natural wisdom that operates spontaneously in all situations.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? Yes - focuses on universal human capacity for discernment
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible
3. Practically applicable? Yes - connects to daily decision-making and understanding
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal discernment to universal truth
5. Development clear? Yes - shows progression from basic to refined discernment
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - listed concrete expressions and applications

The description maintains the sophistication of the original Sanskrit concept while making it accessible and practically relevant across cultural contexts. It preserves the developmental and transformative aspects while grounding them in universal human experience.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universal description to better meet the objectives?
