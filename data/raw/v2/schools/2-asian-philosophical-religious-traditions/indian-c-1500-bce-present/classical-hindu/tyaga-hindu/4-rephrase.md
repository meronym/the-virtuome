Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Tyāga:

Core Principle:
- Inner release/letting go while maintaining engagement
- Transformation of action through detachment
- Active surrender vs passive resignation

Key Functions:
- Purifies motivation
- Reduces psychological burden
- Enables skillful action
- Develops wisdom through experience
- Facilitates flow states

Systemic Roles:
- Bridge between action and wisdom
- Connector of individual effort and universal flow
- Transformer of ego-driven to ego-transcending action

Developmental Aspects:
- Begins with small renunciations
- Develops through practiced detachment
- Culminates in natural state of non-attachment
- Spirals between understanding and implementation

Based on this analysis, here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to act fully while releasing attachment to outcomes, combining complete engagement with inner freedom. This quality transforms action through the voluntary release of personal agenda, enabling both maximum effectiveness and minimum psychological burden.

[Essential Nature]
At its heart, this quality represents the paradoxical unity of full engagement and complete letting go. It operates by separating action from the psychological weight of personal ownership and outcome-attachment, allowing natural capability to flow unimpeded by ego-concerns. Unlike passive resignation or withdrawal, it enables more perfect action through the release of the very elements that typically constrain performance: self-consciousness, anxiety about results, and the burden of personal ownership.

This release occurs at multiple levels simultaneously: physical tension, emotional attachment, mental fixation, and egoic identification. As these layers of holding dissolve, what remains is pure, responsive action aligned with the needs of the situation rather than personal agenda.

[Manifestations]
- Fluid, effortless action despite high engagement
- Calm acceptance of outcomes without diminished effort
- Natural prioritization unclouded by personal preferences
- Increased effectiveness paired with decreased stress
- Spontaneous alignment with larger purpose
- Clear discrimination between necessary and unnecessary effort
- Simultaneous increase in both capability and equanimity

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive discovery that holding on actually impedes both performance and satisfaction. Through repeated experience, one learns to distinguish between the essential tension needed for action and the unnecessary tension of psychological holding. This understanding naturally leads to the release of constraining patterns while retaining full functional engagement.

In practical application, it manifests as the capacity to invest complete effort while remaining inwardly free. This creates a distinctive state where action becomes both more effective and less burdensome. The paradox resolves in experience: releasing personal ownership of action allows access to deeper resources and intelligence, while simultaneously eliminating the psychological stress of outcome-attachment. This enables both better results and greater peace.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: Yes - describes universal human experience of action, effort, and attachment
2. Preservation of depth: Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear implications for action and development
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - links personal experience to universal principles
5. Developmental clarity: Yes - shows progression from understanding to implementation
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - listed effects are concrete and verifiable

The description maintains the sophisticated understanding of tyāga while making it accessible to those without Hindu philosophical background. It preserves the paradoxical unity of full engagement and complete detachment that makes this concept especially valuable, while describing it in experiential rather than theoretical terms.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
