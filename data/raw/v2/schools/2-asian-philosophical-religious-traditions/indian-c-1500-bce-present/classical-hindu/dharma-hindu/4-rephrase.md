Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS - DHARMA:
Core principle: Alignment with natural/cosmic order
Key functions: 
- Orders individual and collective life
- Guides ethical decision-making
- Maintains social harmony
- Connects individual action to universal principles
- Provides framework for development

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Sense of "right order" in nature and life
- Need for ethical guidelines
- Tension between individual/collective good
- Search for meaning and purpose
- Recognition of natural laws/patterns

Contemporary parallels:
- Systems thinking
- Ecological consciousness
- Role ethics
- Sustainable development
- Social responsibility

Here's my attempt at a universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The innate ordering principle that governs both natural and human systems, manifesting as the capacity to recognize, align with, and actively maintain right relationship within the greater whole. It represents the dynamic balance between individual authentic expression and the harmonious functioning of larger systems.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the fundamental pattern of coherent relationship that exists at all levels of reality - from physical laws to ecological systems to human societies. It operates simultaneously as an objective principle of natural order and a subjective capacity for discerning and acting in alignment with that order. Unlike rigid rules or abstract ideals, it is a dynamic principle that requires constant recognition of and adaptation to the specific context while maintaining fidelity to universal patterns.

This quality manifests through the recognition that each entity has its authentic nature and role within larger systems, and that individual flourishing occurs through discovering and expressing this nature in ways that contribute to systemic harmony. It provides the foundation for both personal integrity and social coherence.

[Manifestations]
- Recognition of natural patterns and principles in all situations
- Capacity to discern appropriate action in specific contexts
- Balance between individual authenticity and systemic harmony
- Ethical decision-making that considers multiple levels of impact
- Sense of purpose aligned with larger patterns of meaning
- Development of role-specific excellence and competence
- Integration of personal growth with collective wellbeing

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive recognition of patterns and relationships, from immediate personal interactions to broader systemic implications. It begins with learning basic patterns of beneficial behavior, evolves through understanding underlying principles, and matures into intuitive recognition of right action in any context. This development involves increasingly subtle discrimination of how universal principles manifest in specific situations.

In practical expression, this quality enables navigation of complex ethical decisions, maintenance of healthy relationships, and contribution to collective wellbeing. It manifests as a natural sense of appropriate action that simultaneously serves individual development and systemic harmony. This creates a dynamic balance where personal authentic expression naturally contributes to the flourishing of the larger whole.
```

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: Focuses on universal patterns of order and relationship
2. Depth preservation: Maintains both practical and metaphysical dimensions
3. Practical applicability: Links abstract principles to concrete decisions/actions
4. Individual-Universal connection: Explicitly connects personal and systemic levels
5. Developmental clarity: Shows progression from basic to mature understanding
6. Observable manifestations: Listed in concrete, verifiable terms

The reformulation aims to capture Dharma's essence as a universal principle while making it accessible and applicable across cultural contexts. It preserves the sophisticated understanding of individual-collective relationship while expressing it in phenomenological rather than traditional religious terms.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this reformulation to better meet the objectives?
