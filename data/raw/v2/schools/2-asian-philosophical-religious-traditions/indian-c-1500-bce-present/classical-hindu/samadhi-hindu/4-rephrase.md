Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Samādhi:
- Core principle: Integration of consciousness/awareness
- Key functions: Unification, transcendence, deep knowing
- Systemic role: Ultimate developmental milestone
- Developmental aspect: Progressive deepening of awareness

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
- Universal experiences: Deep flow states, peak experiences, profound clarity
- Cross-cultural parallels: Mystical union, peak performance, profound insight
- Contemporary relevance: Optimal functioning, consciousness research, deep learning
- Timeless patterns: Integration, clarity, transcendence of subject-object divide

Here's my attempt at a universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for complete integration of awareness, where fragmented experiences merge into unified understanding. A state of profound clarity and direct knowing where the usual boundaries between observer and observed, knower and known, self and experience dissolve into seamless wholeness.

[Essential Nature]
Integration represents the natural tendency of consciousness to move toward wholeness and clarity when barriers are removed. Like a thousand ripples settling into still water, it's the mind's return to its fundamental unified state. This quality manifests as progressive levels of integration - from momentary experiences of flow and clarity to profound states of unified awareness.

This integration isn't merely a passive state but an active capacity of consciousness to transcend its usual fragmentary operation. It represents the mind's inherent ability to know directly, beyond the usual mechanisms of conceptual thinking and dualistic perception.

[Manifestations]
- Experiences of profound clarity where complexity resolves into simple understanding
- States of deep absorption where doer and doing merge completely
- Moments of direct knowing that transcend step-by-step reasoning
- Progressive dissolution of perceived boundaries between self and experience
- Spontaneous resolution of psychological conflicts through higher integration
- Access to deeper layers of understanding and wisdom
- Natural emergence of appropriate action without deliberation

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a progressive refinement of awareness. Initially appearing as moments of flow or unusual clarity, it deepens through dedicated practice and cultivation of supporting conditions. The process involves both active development of attention and letting go of habitual patterns that maintain fragmentation. Key factors include sustained attention, progressive surrender of psychological barriers, and cultivation of subtler awareness.

In practical terms, this integration manifests as enhanced functioning across all domains of life. Decision-making becomes more intuitive and holistic, understanding arises spontaneously rather than through laborious analysis, and action flows naturally from clear seeing rather than deliberate planning. This brings both greater effectiveness and profound peace, as the usual sense of struggle and separation dissolves into natural flow and harmony.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: ✓ Uses universal human experiences of clarity, integration, and direct knowing
2. Preservation of depth: ✓ Maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language
3. Practical applicability: ✓ Connects to observable experiences and developmental processes
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ Links personal experience to universal principles
5. Developmental clarity: ✓ Describes progressive development from common to profound states
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ Lists verifiable expressions in experience and behavior

The reformulation maintains the profound depth of samādhi while making it accessible through universal human experiences of integration, clarity, and direct knowing. It preserves the sophisticated understanding of consciousness while providing practical markers and developmental guidelines.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this reformulation?
