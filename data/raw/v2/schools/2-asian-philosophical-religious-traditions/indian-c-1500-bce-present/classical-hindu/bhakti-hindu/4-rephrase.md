Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS FOR BHAKTI:
Core principle: Transformative devotional love that bridges personal and universal
Key functions: 
- Integration of emotion and spirituality
- Transformation of ordinary love to universal love
- Channel for personal development through devotion
- Method of self-transcendence through relationship

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Deep love and devotion
- Transcendent relationships
- Self-giving connection
- Transformative dedication
- Heart-centered wisdom

Here's my attempt at a universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for transformative love that elevates ordinary emotional connection into a vehicle for personal growth and universal understanding. It represents the integration of heart-centered devotion with deep wisdom, where passionate dedication becomes a path to self-transcendence and expanded consciousness.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents a distinct form of love that transcends ordinary attachment while incorporating its emotional power. It operates through the progressive refinement of feeling, where personal love expands into universal connection through dedicated practice and emotional maturation. Unlike conventional love, it intentionally uses the power of deep devotional relationship as a transformative force.

The quality combines passionate intensity with profound wisdom, creating a sustainable path of development through relationship and dedication. It transforms emotional energy into spiritual awareness while maintaining the heart's essential warmth and authenticity.

[Manifestations]
- Deep, sustained dedication to people, principles, or pursuits that transcend self-interest
- Spontaneous expressions of joy, care, and celebration in relationship to what one values
- Progressive refinement of emotional capacity, from personal to universal love
- Integration of feeling and wisdom through devoted practice
- Transformation of ordinary activities into expressions of deeper meaning through loving attention
- Development of intuitive wisdom through heart-centered engagement
- Capacity to maintain emotional warmth while transcending attachment

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the intentional cultivation of refined emotional connection. It begins with natural feelings of love and devotion, which are progressively deepened and expanded through conscious practice. The process involves both intensification and purification of feeling, where emotional energy is channeled into increasingly subtle and universal expressions while maintaining its essential vitality and warmth.

In practical terms, it manifests as an ability to engage deeply and wholeheartedly while maintaining wisdom and discrimination. It creates a bridge between personal and universal experience through the vehicle of relationship, allowing individuals to access profound insights through heart-centered dedication rather than purely intellectual means. This makes abstract principles tangible and accessible through direct emotional experience while progressively expanding the heart's capacity for universal connection.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Yes - focuses on universal human capacity for transformative love
2. Preserves depth: Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding of love as developmental path
3. Practical applicability: Yes - describes observable manifestations and development process
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - shows progression from personal to universal
5. Developmental clarity: Yes - outlines progression and transformation process
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - listed concrete expressions and behaviors

The reformulation maintains the sophisticated understanding of bhakti while making it accessible to those outside the Hindu tradition. It preserves the depth of the concept while expressing it in universal human terms of love, dedication, and transformation.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this reformulation?
