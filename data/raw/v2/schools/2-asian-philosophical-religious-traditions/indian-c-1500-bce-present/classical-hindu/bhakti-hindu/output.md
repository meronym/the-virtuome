[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the intentional cultivation of refined emotional connection. It begins with natural feelings of love and devotion, which are progressively deepened and expanded through conscious practice. The process involves both intensification and purification of feeling, where emotional energy is channeled into increasingly subtle and universal expressions while maintaining its essential vitality and warmth.

In practical terms, it manifests as an ability to engage deeply and wholeheartedly while maintaining wisdom and discrimination.
