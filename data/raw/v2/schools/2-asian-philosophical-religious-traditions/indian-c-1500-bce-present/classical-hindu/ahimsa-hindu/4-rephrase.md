Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The active principle of non-harming that operates through conscious restraint and positive care. It manifests as the capacity to navigate life without causing harm while actively promoting wellbeing, extending from physical actions to thoughts and attitudes, ultimately embracing all forms of life and existence.

[Essential Nature]
Non-harming represents a fundamental orientation toward life that recognizes the interconnected nature of existence and responds with conscious care. It operates both as a restraining force preventing harmful actions and as a positive force generating protection and nurture. This quality develops through progressive refinement of awareness and action, beginning with gross physical restraint and evolving toward subtle mental and emotional harmony.

The power of non-harming lies in its transformation of natural aggressive impulses into constructive force. Rather than mere passivity or avoidance, it embodies active engagement with life's challenges through wisdom and care, leading to both individual peace and collective harmony.

[Manifestations]
- Physical: Gentle movement, careful action, protection of life
- Verbal: Thoughtful speech, truth spoken with care, peace-making communication
- Mental: Cultivation of benevolent thoughts, absence of ill-will, positive intention
- Emotional: Development of empathy, compassion, universal goodwill
- Ecological: Conscious consumption, environmental care, sustainable living
- Social: Conflict resolution, peace-building, protective service
- Internal: Self-acceptance, gentle self-discipline, harmonious development

[Functional Description]
Non-harming operates through heightened awareness of interconnection combined with responsive care. It begins with conscious restraint of harmful impulses, developing through understanding of cause and effect in relationships. As awareness deepens, it naturally extends beyond immediate interactions to encompass broader circles of life and existence. This quality grows through practical exercise in daily situations, each choice building capacity for more refined expression.

In practice, non-harming manifests as skillful navigation of relationships and challenges. It enables resolution of conflicts without escalation, protection of the vulnerable without aggression, and promotion of wellbeing without domination. This quality creates a foundation for both personal peace and collective harmony, transforming environments through its active presence while supporting sustainable development of human potential.
