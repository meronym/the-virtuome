Let me follow the structured approach:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Integration of conscious restraint with mindful control
Key functions: Purification, prevention of harmful actions, cultivation of mastery
Systemic role: Foundation for higher development, enables other virtues
Developmental: Progresses from external to internal regulation

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences: Self-regulation, impulse control, mindful choice
Parallel concepts: Self-mastery, disciplined awareness, integrated control
Contemporary relevance: Emotional intelligence, habit formation, intentional living
Timeless patterns: Progressive development of conscious control over automatic reactions

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for integrated self-regulation through conscious awareness and intentional control, manifesting as the skillful management of attention, energy, and response across physical, verbal, and mental dimensions of experience. This faculty enables purposeful choice over automatic reaction.

[Essential Nature]
Self-regulation represents the conscious interface between intention and action, operating through three interconnected mechanisms: awareness, choice, and implementation. Unlike simple suppression or rigid control, it develops as an adaptive capacity that combines restraint with responsive flexibility. This quality emerges from the interaction between mindful awareness, clear discrimination, and practiced control, creating a sustainable foundation for personal development and ethical action.

[Manifestations]
Physical Domain:
- Measured, purposeful movement
- Conscious regulation of energy
- Mindful consumption and activity
- Poised rather than reactive stance

Verbal Domain:
- Considered rather than impulsive speech
- Appropriate timing and tone
- Economy of expression
- Integration of silence

Mental Domain:
- Sustained attention control
- Emotional equilibrium
- Thought pattern awareness
- Response rather than reaction

Developmental Progression:
- From external guidance to internal regulation
- From rigid control to flexible mastery
- From effort to natural expression
- From specific contexts to universal application

[Functional Description]
This faculty operates through a continuous cycle of awareness, evaluation, and conscious response. The process begins with clear recognition of arising impulses, transitions through discriminative understanding of appropriate action, and culminates in skillful implementation of chosen response. This creates a progressive refinement of control that becomes increasingly natural and comprehensive.

In practical application, this quality manifests as a composed presence that responds appropriately to circumstances without suppression or reactivity. It enables one to maintain ethical integrity, emotional balance, and effective action across varying conditions. The result is a sustainable form of self-guidance that enhances rather than constrains natural functioning, leading to increased capability and decreased internal conflict.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural: Focuses on universal human capacities
2. Depth: Preserves sophisticated understanding of control/awareness relationship
3. Applicability: Clear practical dimensions and progressive development
4. Individual/Universal: Links personal practice to universal principles
5. Development: Clear progression from basic to advanced manifestation
6. Observable: Concrete manifestations in behavior and experience

The description maintains the sophisticated understanding of conscious self-regulation from the Jain tradition while making it accessible and applicable in contemporary contexts. It preserves the integration of awareness and control central to Saá¹ƒyama while expressing it in universal experiential terms.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
