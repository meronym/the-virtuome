Let me analyze Anekāntavāda following our framework.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Multi-perspectival awareness and epistemological humility
Key functions: 
- Cognitive flexibility
- Perspective integration
- Conflict resolution
- Truth-seeking
- Intellectual humility

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Common human experiences:
- Encountering differing viewpoints
- Realizing limitations of personal perspective
- Discovering complexity in seemingly simple matters
- Growing beyond black-and-white thinking
- Integrating contradictory truths

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize and integrate multiple valid perspectives of reality, coupled with the deep understanding that truth is multifaceted and no single viewpoint captures it completely. This quality manifests as intellectual humility, cognitive flexibility, and the ability to hold and reconcile seemingly contradictory viewpoints.

[Essential Nature]
At its heart, this quality represents the mature development of human consciousness beyond rigid, singular perspectives toward a more comprehensive understanding of reality. It emerges from the recognition that our individual viewpoints are inherently limited and that truth often reveals itself through multiple, complementary facets rather than absolute statements.

This quality operates at both cognitive and emotional levels, combining intellectual rigor with psychological openness. It requires both the ability to distinguish fine differences and the capacity to see underlying unity, leading to a more nuanced and complete understanding of reality while maintaining practical effectiveness in action.

[Manifestations]
- Ability to consider and hold multiple perspectives simultaneously without confusion
- Natural tendency to look for complementary rather than contradictory aspects in differing views
- Comfort with complexity and ambiguity while maintaining decisive action capability
- Automatic recognition of context-dependency in statements and beliefs
- Expression of intellectual humility without sacrificing discernment
- Integration of apparently opposing viewpoints into more comprehensive understanding
- Balanced consideration of multiple stakeholders in decision-making

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive recognition of the limitations inherent in single perspectives and direct experience with the multi-faceted nature of reality. It begins with simple perspective-taking ability and matures into a sophisticated capacity to navigate complex systems of thought while maintaining practical effectiveness. The development process involves both intellectual growth and emotional maturation, as the individual learns to hold complexity without becoming paralyzed by it.

In practical application, this quality enables effective navigation of complex personal and professional situations, particularly in contexts involving diverse viewpoints or stakeholders. It facilitates conflict resolution, innovative problem-solving, and balanced decision-making. The quality manifests as a natural tendency to seek understanding rather than judgment, to explore rather than conclude prematurely, and to integrate rather than divide, while maintaining the ability to take clear action when needed.
