Let me first analyze Ahiṃsā following our preparation framework before composing the universal description.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Active recognition and respect for the integrity of all life/existence
Key functions:
- Prevention of harm
- Protection of life
- Cultivation of reverence
- Harmonious coexistence
- Conscious awareness

Systemic roles:
- Foundation for other ethical behavior
- Guide for decision-making
- Basis for environmental awareness
- Framework for relationship dynamics

Developmental aspects:
- Begins with gross physical restraint
- Develops through speech/thought awareness
- Culminates in deep reverence for life
- Expands from personal to universal scope

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Empathetic response to suffering
- Desire to protect vulnerable beings
- Recognition of interconnectedness
- Sense of reverence for life
- Impulse to nurture/care

Contemporary applications:
- Environmental stewardship
- Conflict resolution
- Ethical technology development
- Sustainable living
- Mental/emotional wellbeing

Here's the universal description following our format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The active recognition of and respect for the integrity of all forms of existence, manifesting as conscious awareness of impact, prevention of harm, and positive contribution to the wellbeing of all life. This fundamental orientation of consciousness shapes thought, speech, and action through deepening awareness of interconnection.

[Essential Nature]
At its core, this quality represents the mind's natural capacity to recognize the sanctity of life and consciousness in all its forms. It operates through three progressive dimensions: awareness (recognition of life's sensitivity and complexity), restraint (conscious moderation of impact), and positive care (active contribution to wellbeing). Rather than mere prohibition, it embodies an ever-deepening understanding of interconnection and responsibility, transforming from basic harm prevention to profound reverence for existence.

[Manifestations]
Physical Dimension:
- Careful, mindful movement and action
- Gentle, considered interaction with environment
- Protective response toward vulnerable beings
- Conscious consumption and resource use

Mental/Emotional Dimension:
- Recognition of impact before action
- Empathetic awareness of others' states
- Development of emotional sensitivity
- Cultivation of protective awareness

Relational Dimension:
- Creation of safe spaces for others
- Supportive presence in relationships
- Careful attention to impact of words
- Active contribution to others' wellbeing

Developmental Progression:
- From gross to subtle awareness
- From restraint to active care
- From personal to universal scope
- From rule to natural expression

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of awareness and response. Beginning with basic recognition of obvious harm, it evolves through increasing sensitivity to subtle impacts in thought, speech, and action. This development naturally expands from personal behavior to environmental awareness, from immediate interactions to long-term consequences, creating an ever-widening sphere of conscious care and consideration.

In practical expression, it manifests as careful attention to movement, speech, and thought; conscious consumption and resource use; supportive presence in relationships; and active contribution to environmental wellbeing. Rather than restriction, it represents freedom through awareness, enabling more harmonious and sustainable ways of living and relating. This quality fundamentally transforms one's relationship with all of existence from unconscious impact to conscious care.

This description aims to:
- Capture the depth of the original Jain concept
- Make it accessible without religious/cultural framework
- Preserve its sophisticated understanding of consciousness and behavior
- Maintain practical applicability
- Connect individual practice to universal significance
- Show clear developmental progression
- Identify observable manifestations

Would you like me to analyze how well this meets our verification questions or refine any particular aspect?
