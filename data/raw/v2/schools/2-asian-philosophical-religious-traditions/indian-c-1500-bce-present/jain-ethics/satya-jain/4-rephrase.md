Let me follow the structured approach to universalize Satya.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Alignment of inner understanding with outer expression
Key functions: Creates trust, enables clear perception, fosters authenticity
Systemic role: Foundation for ethical conduct and self-development
Developmental aspects: Progresses from basic honesty to profound authenticity

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Gap between knowledge and expression
- Inner conflict between truth and convenience
- Desire for authentic self-expression
- Need for reliable information and trust

STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Primary: Truth as alignment rather than mere factual accuracy
Secondary: Barriers of fear, desire, and confusion

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The quality of inner and outer alignment - maintaining harmony between understanding, expression, and action. It manifests as the capacity to perceive clearly, communicate authentically, and act with integrity, while remaining sensitive to the impact of truth on others.

[Essential Nature]
Truth as a quality of consciousness extends beyond mere factual accuracy or honest speech. It represents a state of fundamental alignment where perception, understanding, expression, and action form a seamless whole. This alignment creates clarity in both the internal and external dimensions of experience.

This quality develops through progressive refinement of perception, dissolution of self-deception, and cultivation of precise expression. It requires both courage to face reality and wisdom to express truth skillfully, especially when dealing with complex situations where multiple valid perspectives exist.

[Manifestations]
- Clear perception: Seeing reality without distortion from preferences or aversions
- Internal coherence: Alignment between thoughts, words, and actions
- Authentic expression: Communication that accurately reflects understanding
- Skillful truth-telling: Considering timing, context, and impact
- Depth of understanding: Recognizing multiple levels of truth in situations
- Self-honesty: Willingness to acknowledge uncomfortable realities
- Integrity in action: Consistent expression of understood truth

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by continuously harmonizing inner understanding with outer expression. It acts as an internal compass that detects misalignment between knowledge and action, thought and speech, intention and behavior. Through this detection, it guides adjustment toward greater coherence, much like a musician naturally adjusts to maintain pitch and rhythm.

In practical terms, it manifests as a growing capacity to face reality directly, communicate clearly, and act consistently. This creates trustworthy relationships, enables effective collaboration, and fosters personal growth through honest self-reflection. The quality develops through conscious practice in daily situations, particularly when facing challenges that tempt one to avoid or distort truth.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural? Yes - focuses on universal human experience of alignment
2. Preserves depth? Yes - captures both practical and profound aspects
3. Practical? Yes - clear manifestations and developmental path
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal practice to broader impact
5. Development clear? Yes - shows progression from basic to refined
6. Observable? Yes - manifestations are concrete and verifiable

This universalization maintains the sophisticated understanding of truth from the Jain tradition while making it accessible and practical for contemporary application across cultures. It preserves the nuanced understanding that truth is not merely about speaking facts but about a deeper alignment of being.
