Let me follow the analytical process and then create the universal description.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Balanced, equanimous awareness that remains stable across experiences
Functions: Mental equilibrium, emotional balance, clear perception, non-reactive presence
Systemic role: Stabilizing quality enabling wisdom and compassion
Developmental: Progresses from basic emotional regulation to profound existential equipoise

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Finding calm in difficulty
- Maintaining perspective in stress
- Balanced response to success/failure
- Clear seeing beyond personal preferences

Parallel concepts:
- Psychological resilience
- Emotional equilibrium
- Mindful presence
- Objective awareness

Here's the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain clear, balanced awareness across all experience while remaining fully engaged yet internally free. This quality combines steady presence with profound acceptance, allowing both intimate connection with life and the spaciousness to hold all experiences with equipoise.

[Essential Nature]
Equanimity operates as an integrative capacity of human consciousness that balances engagement with non-attachment. Unlike emotional numbness or detachment, it represents a highly refined stability that remains fully sensitive and responsive while free from compulsive reactivity. This quality develops through increasingly subtle recognition of how we relate to experience itself, gradually revealing a natural spaciousness that can hold all phenomena without becoming overwhelmed or entangled.

[Manifestations]
- Maintaining steady presence and clarity during intense emotional experiences
- Responding to success and failure with balanced perspective
- Engaging fully in relationships while allowing others complete freedom
- Meeting pleasure and pain without grasping or aversion
- Holding multiple viewpoints with deep understanding yet without becoming lost in any
- Functioning effectively amid uncertainty and change
- Expressing warmth and care without emotional dependency

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of our relationship with experience itself. Beginning with basic emotional regulation, it evolves through increasingly subtle recognition of how we create suffering through reactive patterns of attachment and aversion. As insight deepens, natural spaciousness of awareness becomes apparent, allowing both intimate engagement with life and profound inner freedom.

In practical terms, this manifests as an ability to remain steady and clear across all circumstances while maintaining full sensitivity and appropriate responsiveness. It enables both deep connection with others and the space for them to be as they are, bringing wisdom to relationships and effectiveness to action. This balanced awareness becomes particularly valuable during challenging experiences, major life transitions, and in working with others in difficult circumstances.

This universal description aims to:
1. Capture the profound depth of the original Jain concept
2. Make it accessible through familiar human experiences
3. Maintain practical relevance while preserving sophistication
4. Connect individual practice with universal principles
5. Show clear developmental trajectory
6. Provide observable manifestations
7. Demonstrate contemporary applications

The description bridges contemplative wisdom with modern understanding of human development and psychology, making the virtue accessible while maintaining its transformative potential.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universal description?
