Here's the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Transformative wisdom that unites deep understanding with practical discernment, manifesting as the capacity to perceive truth clearly and act from that perception with skill and ethical awareness. This wisdom develops through the integration of experience, insight, and application in daily life.

[Essential Nature]
Transformative wisdom represents the maturation of human consciousness where intellectual understanding, intuitive insight, and practical effectiveness unite. It transcends mere accumulation of knowledge, manifesting instead as a dynamic capacity for skillful action rooted in clear perception of reality. This quality combines penetrating discernment with compassionate understanding, enabling both profound insight and effective action in service of human flourishing.

[Manifestations]
- Clear discernment between essential and superficial aspects of situations
- Natural integration of understanding and action without hesitation
- Skillful navigation of complex ethical decisions
- Ability to perceive underlying patterns and principles
- Teaching and sharing wisdom in ways others can understand and apply
- Balanced judgment that considers multiple perspectives
- Practical effectiveness emerging from deep understanding

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through an iterative process of learning, reflection, and application. As theoretical understanding meets practical experience, it transforms into living wisdom that operates spontaneously in daily life. This wisdom functions as an internal compass, guiding decisions and actions through direct perception rather than rule-following or abstract reasoning.

In practical expression, it manifests as the capacity to understand situations deeply while responding effectively. This includes seeing beyond surface appearances, recognizing underlying patterns, and taking skillful action that addresses root causes rather than symptoms. It enables one to teach and guide others naturally, translating complex understanding into accessible insights and practical solutions.

This universal description aims to:
1. Capture the essence of Gian while making it accessible across cultures
2. Preserve the depth of the original Sikh concept
3. Emphasize practical application and development
4. Connect individual growth with universal wisdom
5. Highlight observable manifestations
6. Maintain philosophical sophistication while using experiential language

Would you like me to:
1. Adjust any aspect of the description?
2. Elaborate on specific elements?
3. Add more practical examples?
4. Explore developmental aspects in more detail?
