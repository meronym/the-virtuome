[Core Definition]
The active recognition of universal human interconnectedness expressed through practical commitment to collective flourishing. It manifests as an ever-expanding circle of care and responsibility, transforming abstract universal goodwill into concrete actions benefiting the whole of humanity and life itself.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the maturation of human consciousness from individual to universal concern, expressing as both an understanding and a practice. It combines clear recognition of human interconnectedness with active responsibility for collective welfare. Unlike passive well-wishing, it demands practical engagement with human suffering and social challenges, transcending all divisions of religion, culture, nationality, or status.

The quality develops through progressive expansion of one's circle of concern, eventually encompassing all life. This expansion occurs not just in thought but in practical action, transforming abstract universal love into concrete service and responsibility.

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through progressive transformation of consciousness combined with practical action. It begins with recognition of human interconnectedness, develops through expansion of empathetic concern, and matures into active responsibility for collective welfare. The development process involves both internal realization and external action, each reinforcing the other through practical engagement with human needs and social challenges.

In daily life, it manifests as consistent consideration of broader impact in personal choices, active engagement in service activities, and practical support for initiatives benefiting the collective. It influences decision-making at all levels, from personal consumption choices to organizational leadership, consistently expanding the circle of consideration beyond immediate self-interest to universal benefit. This quality becomes particularly evident in crisis situations, where it drives spontaneous humanitarian response transcending usual social boundaries.
