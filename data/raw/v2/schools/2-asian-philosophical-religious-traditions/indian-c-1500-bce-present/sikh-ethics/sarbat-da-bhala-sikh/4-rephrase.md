Let me first analyze the concept following our preparation framework before composing the output.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
- Core principle: Universal welfare consciousness manifesting as active care
- Key functions: Expanding circle of concern, transcending boundaries, active beneficence
- Systemic role: Links individual development with collective flourishing
- Developmental aspects: Progresses from personal to universal care consciousness

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal Human Experiences:
- Recognition of shared humanity
- Expansion of care beyond immediate circle
- Desire to contribute to collective good
- Sense of universal interconnection

Parallel Concepts:
- Ubuntu (African: human interconnectedness)
- Ren (Confucian: human-heartedness)
- Agape (Christian: universal love)
- Metta (Buddhist: universal loving-kindness)

Contemporary Applications:
- Global citizenship
- Environmental stewardship
- Social justice activism
- Humanitarian work
- Inclusive community building

Based on this analysis, here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The active recognition of universal human interconnectedness expressed through practical commitment to collective flourishing. It manifests as an ever-expanding circle of care and responsibility, transforming abstract universal goodwill into concrete actions benefiting the whole of humanity and life itself.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the maturation of human consciousness from individual to universal concern, expressing as both an understanding and a practice. It combines clear recognition of human interconnectedness with active responsibility for collective welfare. Unlike passive well-wishing, it demands practical engagement with human suffering and social challenges, transcending all divisions of religion, culture, nationality, or status.

The quality develops through progressive expansion of one's circle of concern, eventually encompassing all life. This expansion occurs not just in thought but in practical action, transforming abstract universal love into concrete service and responsibility.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous recognition of others' needs regardless of group affiliations
- Active engagement in community service beyond cultural boundaries
- Practical initiatives promoting collective welfare
- Decision-making that considers impact on all stakeholders
- Resource sharing and distribution beyond immediate community
- Environmental stewardship as expression of universal care
- Leadership oriented toward inclusive collective benefit

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through progressive transformation of consciousness combined with practical action. It begins with recognition of human interconnectedness, develops through expansion of empathetic concern, and matures into active responsibility for collective welfare. The development process involves both internal realization and external action, each reinforcing the other through practical engagement with human needs and social challenges.

In daily life, it manifests as consistent consideration of broader impact in personal choices, active engagement in service activities, and practical support for initiatives benefiting the collective. It influences decision-making at all levels, from personal consumption choices to organizational leadership, consistently expanding the circle of consideration beyond immediate self-interest to universal benefit. This quality becomes particularly evident in crisis situations, where it drives spontaneous humanitarian response transcending usual social boundaries.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the active, practical nature of the original concept
2. Maintains the connection between individual development and collective welfare
3. Emphasizes observable manifestations
4. Links personal practice to universal impact
5. Retains the distinctive combination of consciousness and action
6. Makes the concept accessible across cultural contexts

Would you like me to:
1. Further elaborate any aspect?
2. Provide more specific examples of manifestations?
3. Develop practical application guidelines?
4. Explore developmental stages in more detail?
