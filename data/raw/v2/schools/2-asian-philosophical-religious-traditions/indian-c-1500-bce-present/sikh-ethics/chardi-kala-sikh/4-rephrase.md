Here's my attempt at a universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain genuine, grounded optimism and inner vitality regardless of external circumstances, combining psychological resilience with spiritual awareness to produce a sustainable state of positive engagement with life's challenges and opportunities.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents a sophisticated form of psychological and spiritual maturity where optimism emerges not from denial or forced positivity, but from a deeper understanding of life's nature. It differs from simple optimism by incorporating full awareness of difficulties while maintaining authentic positive engagement. The quality combines emotional resilience, psychological buoyancy, and spiritual groundedness to create a stable foundation for positive action regardless of circumstances.

Unlike temporal happiness dependent on favorable conditions, this state draws from a deeper well of understanding that recognizes challenge and growth as integral aspects of human experience. It manifests as a dynamic, sustainable positive engagement with life that becomes more stable through adversity rather than being diminished by it.

[Manifestations]
- Maintaining positive engagement during adversity without denial or toxic positivity
- Demonstrating emotional resilience that strengthens rather than depletes through challenges
- Converting obstacles into opportunities for growth and deeper understanding
- Exhibiting genuine joy and enthusiasm that inspires others naturally
- Balancing realistic assessment of difficulties with unwavering positive orientation
- Showing consistent positive engagement independent of external circumstances
- Demonstrating sustainable optimism that deepens through life experience

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a unique combination of emotional intelligence, psychological resilience, and deeper understanding of life's nature. Rather than suppressing negative experiences or forcing positive thoughts, it emerges from recognizing the growth potential inherent in all experiences. The quality develops through progressive integration of challenging experiences, each difficulty strengthening rather than weakening one's positive orientation.

In practical expression, it manifests as a natural, unforced positive engagement with life that others find authentic and inspiring. This quality enables effective leadership during crisis, maintained positive impact during adversity, and consistent constructive engagement with life's challenges. It creates a contagious form of sustainable optimism that strengthens communities and supports collective resilience while remaining deeply personal and genuine.
