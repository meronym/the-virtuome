Let me follow the process systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Active responsiveness to suffering combined with wisdom
Key functions:
- Recognition of suffering
- Emotional resonance
- Wise discernment
- Skillful response
- Universal scope

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Recognition of shared vulnerability
- Natural response to others' pain
- Desire to help/alleviate suffering
- Balance of heart and wisdom
- Connection through understanding

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary:
- Recognition + Response capacity
- Heart-mind integration
- Progressive development
- Universal expansion

Secondary:
- Emotional overwhelm (obstacle)
- Wisdom development (condition)
- Balance of engagement/boundaries
- Practical helping skills

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, be moved by, and respond wisely to suffering in oneself and others. It combines emotional sensitivity with practical wisdom, manifesting as the natural impulse to alleviate distress joined with the discernment to act effectively and sustainably.

[Essential Nature]
Compassion emerges from the recognition of our shared vulnerability and fundamental interconnectedness. It operates as an integration of heart and mind: the heart's natural resonance with suffering combines with the mind's capacity for understanding and skillful response. Unlike mere emotional empathy, it includes the wisdom component that enables effective action without becoming overwhelmed. This quality develops from personal to universal scope, gradually expanding its radius of concern while maintaining practical effectiveness.

[Manifestations]
- Immediate recognition and appropriate response to suffering when encountered
- Balance of emotional sensitivity with stable presence
- Practical wisdom in choosing effective helping actions
- Sustainable engagement without burnout or overwhelm
- Progressive expansion from personal to universal concern
- Integration of care with clear boundaries
- Development of specific helping skills and knowledge

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interaction between emotional resonance and practical wisdom. The emotional component provides the motivation and energy for response, while the wisdom aspect ensures effectiveness and sustainability. It develops through progressive challenges that strengthen both the capacity to stay present with suffering and the ability to respond skillfully.

In practice, it manifests as a natural, spontaneous response to suffering combined with intelligent discernment about appropriate action. This creates a sustainable way of engaging with others' difficulties that neither walls off emotional sensitivity nor becomes overwhelmed by it. The result is effective care that benefits both giver and receiver while expanding one's sphere of concern and capability.

Does this universalization:
1. Cross cultures? Yes - based on universal human experiences of suffering and helping
2. Preserve depth? Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding of emotion-wisdom integration
3. Practical? Yes - clear behavioral manifestations and development path
4. Individual-Universal? Yes - shows progression from personal to universal scope
5. Development clear? Yes - describes both emotional and wisdom aspects of growth
6. Observable? Yes - specific behavioral markers and manifestations listed

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
