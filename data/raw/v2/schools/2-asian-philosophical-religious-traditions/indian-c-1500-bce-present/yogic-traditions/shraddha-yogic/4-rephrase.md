Let me follow the structured process:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF SHRADDHA:
Core principle: Mature trust/faith based on understanding and experience
Key functions: 
- Sustains practice through difficulties
- Bridges known and unknown
- Supports growth and transformation
- Enables deeper exploration

Relationship patterns:
- Develops through experience
- Reinforced by results
- Balances critical thinking
- Supports other virtues

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Learning new skills
- Pursuing long-term goals
- Facing uncertainty
- Building confidence through experience
- Developing trust in process

3. STRUCTURAL INTEGRATION:
Here's my attempt at the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The mature capacity to maintain steady conviction in worthwhile pursuits despite uncertainty, combining experiential trust with reasoned understanding. This quality enables sustained engagement with growth processes while bridging the known and unknown aspects of human development.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the integration of critical intelligence with open receptivity to deeper possibilities. Unlike blind faith or mere belief, it emerges from the intersection of direct experience, rational understanding, and intuitive recognition of potential. It functions as both an enabling and sustaining force, providing the foundation for long-term development while offering resilience through challenges.

This capacity develops through progressive validation, where initial hypothesis becomes grounded understanding through direct experience and careful observation. It maintains a dynamic balance between healthy skepticism and open receptivity, between intellectual rigor and heart-centered knowing.

[Manifestations]
- Sustained commitment to practice or development despite temporary setbacks
- Balanced integration of critical thinking with openness to new possibilities
- Quiet confidence based on accumulated experience rather than mere belief
- Resilient engagement with challenging growth processes
- Natural trust in verified principles and tested methods
- Capacity to work with uncertainty while maintaining direction
- Recognition of deeper patterns and principles beyond surface appearances

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a progressive refinement of understanding, where initial conceptual grasp evolves into embodied knowing through direct experience. It creates a positive feedback loop where small successes build confidence, enabling deeper engagement, which in turn validates and strengthens the original trust. This process transforms abstract appreciation into concrete knowing while maintaining openness to further development.

In practical application, it manifests as the ability to maintain steady engagement with long-term development processes despite uncertainties or temporary challenges. It enables both careful discrimination and deep commitment, allowing one to invest fully in growth opportunities while maintaining discerning awareness. This creates a foundation for sustained development in any field requiring long-term dedication to mastery.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? Yes - describes universal human experience of developing trust through experience
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear connections to learning and development processes
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal development to universal patterns
5. Development clear? Yes - describes progressive refinement through experience
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - listed concrete expressions and behaviors

The description maintains the sophisticated understanding of shraddha while making it accessible and relevant to contemporary contexts and universal human experience. It preserves the depth while avoiding culture-specific terminology or concepts.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this description?
