Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Ahimsa:
Core principle: Active state of non-harming consciousness
Key functions: 
- Prevention of harm
- Cultivation of peace
- Generation of safety
- Promotion of harmony
Systemic role: Foundational quality enabling all other virtuous development

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Desire for safety and peace
- Impact of harmful/peaceful actions
- Interconnectedness of wellbeing
- Ripple effects of behavior

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Primary patterns:
- Progresses from gross to subtle
- Expands from personal to universal
- Transforms from restraint to positive force
- Develops from action to consciousness

Here's my attempt at the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize and actively maintain the interconnected web of wellbeing through conscious non-harming. This quality manifests as a positive force that creates conditions for life to flourish, operating through physical action, speech, thought, and presence, transforming potential conflict into harmony.

[Essential Nature]
Non-harming represents the fundamental recognition that all life seeks to thrive and avoid suffering, combined with the developed capacity to honor this universal principle. It begins as conscious restraint from causing harm but matures into an active force that promotes wellbeing at all levels. This quality arises from deep understanding of interconnection and manifests as a natural state of peace that positively influences all surrounding life.

The mature expression of non-harming transcends mere avoidance of negative action to become a powerful presence that naturally reduces conflict, soothes disturbance, and creates conditions for growth and healing. It operates as both an individual practice and a field effect, transforming not only one's own actions but influencing the broader environment toward greater harmony.

[Manifestations]
Physical Level:
- Gentle, considered movement and action
- Care and protection of life forms
- Creation of safe spaces
- Peaceful resolution of conflict

Speech Level:
- Words that heal rather than wound
- Communication that builds bridges
- Truth spoken with compassion
- Language that promotes understanding

Mental Level:
- Recognition of harmful thought patterns
- Cultivation of peaceful intention
- Development of inclusive awareness
- Understanding of interconnection

Presence Level:
- Natural calming effect on environment
- Ability to defuse tension
- Creation of trust and safety
- Promotion of natural harmony

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of awareness and action. Beginning with gross physical restraint, it evolves through increasingly subtle levels of speech, thought, and energy. Each stage of development deepens understanding of causation and expands the sphere of consideration, ultimately leading to a natural state where non-harming becomes effortless because it aligns with clear perception of reality.

In practical application, this quality transforms challenging situations by introducing a new pattern of response. Rather than reacting to perceived threats or conflicts with counter-aggression, it maintains awareness of underlying unity and seeks solutions that benefit the whole. This creates a positive feedback loop where reduced harmful action leads to reduced defensive reaction, gradually transforming environments and relationships toward greater harmony and thriving.

This universal reformulation aims to:
1. Preserve the depth of the yogic concept
2. Make it accessible across cultures
3. Maintain practical applicability
4. Connect individual practice to universal impact
5. Detail observable manifestations
6. Outline clear development pathway

How well do you think this reformulation meets the quality criteria and answers the verification questions?
