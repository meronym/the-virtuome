Let me follow the process systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Viveka:
Core principle: Discerning awareness that distinguishes true from false
Key functions: 
- Clarity in perception and understanding
- Recognition of patterns and underlying reality
- Separation of essential from non-essential
- Progressive refinement of understanding
Systemic role: Foundational for wisdom development

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Moments of sudden clarity/insight
- Recognition of truth vs appearance
- Development of refined judgment
- Progressive deepening of understanding
- Pattern recognition across contexts

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS identified:
Primary:
- Clear seeing/discernment as basic function
- Progressive refinement as developmental pattern
- Integration of intellectual and intuitive understanding
Secondary:
- Mental clarity as supporting condition
- Confusion/delusion as obstacles
- Wisdom/understanding as related qualities

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Discerning awareness that distinguishes essential from superficial, enabling clear recognition of what is true, valuable, and fundamental in any situation. This refined understanding operates through both analytical clarity and intuitive comprehension, developing progressively through experience and conscious cultivation.

[Essential Nature]
Discerning awareness manifests as the mind's natural capacity to recognize patterns, distinguish levels of reality, and penetrate beyond surface appearances to underlying truth. It combines sharp analytical discrimination with intuitive recognition, operating as an internal compass that guides understanding and action. This faculty develops from basic differentiation to increasingly subtle levels of comprehension, ultimately revealing fundamental patterns and principles across all domains of experience.

[Manifestations]
- Immediate recognition of truth versus appearance in situations
- Clear discrimination between essential and non-essential factors
- Progressive refinement of understanding in any field of study
- Natural recognition of patterns and underlying principles
- Integration of intellectual understanding with intuitive knowing
- Capacity to maintain clarity in complex or confused situations
- Development of refined judgment and decision-making ability

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interaction between focused attention and natural insight. When cultivated, it develops from simple differentiation to increasingly subtle discrimination, eventually becoming an effortless capacity for direct recognition of truth. The faculty strengthens through conscious application in both analytical study and experiential observation, gradually refining both intellectual and intuitive understanding.

In practical application, this discerning awareness serves as an essential tool for navigation through complex situations, decision-making, and deep understanding. It enables clear recognition of what is truly important in any circumstance, helps maintain perspective in challenging situations, and supports both personal development and practical effectiveness. This quality proves particularly valuable in modern contexts of information overload and competing claims to truth.
