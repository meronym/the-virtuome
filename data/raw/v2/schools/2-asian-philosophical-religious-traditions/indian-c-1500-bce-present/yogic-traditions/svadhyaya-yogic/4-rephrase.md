Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Svadhyaya:
Core principle: Systematic self-understanding through observation and study
Key functions: 
- Knowledge integration
- Self-reflection
- Experiential learning
- Pattern recognition
- Growth facilitation

Systemic role:
- Bridge between external knowledge and internal wisdom
- Connector between theory and practice
- Facilitator of conscious development
- Meta-cognitive framework

2. UNIVERSALIZATION ASSESSMENT:
Universal experiences:
- Self-discovery process
- Learning from experience
- Pattern recognition in behavior
- Growing self-awareness
- Integration of knowledge

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary patterns:
- Progressive deepening of understanding
- Spiral of theory and practice
- Integration of multiple awareness levels
- Development of meta-cognitive capacity

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity for systematic self-understanding through intentional observation, reflection, and integration of experience. It combines active investigation of one's patterns, motivations, and behaviors with the studied wisdom of human experience, creating a dynamic feedback loop between knowledge and awareness.

[Essential Nature]
Self-understanding represents a fundamental human capacity that operates through multiple layers of awareness and investigation. It manifests as an active dialogue between direct experience and reflected knowledge, where personal observation meets universal patterns of human development. This quality enables the progressive refinement of awareness through systematic attention to both internal processes and external manifestations of consciousness.

This capacity serves as a meta-framework for human development, allowing for the recognition, understanding, and integration of patterns across all dimensions of experience. It functions as both a method of investigation and a catalyst for transformation, creating bridges between intellectual understanding and lived wisdom.

[Manifestations]
- Sustained attention to internal processes and external behaviors
- Regular reflection on patterns, motivations, and impacts
- Integration of theoretical understanding with personal experience
- Recognition of developmental patterns and growth opportunities
- Systematic documentation and analysis of personal insights
- Active engagement with wisdom traditions and contemporary knowledge
- Development of meta-cognitive awareness and self-regulatory capacity

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay between direct observation and reflective analysis. It creates feedback loops between experience and understanding, where each new insight deepens the capacity for observation, and each observation enriches the framework of understanding. This process naturally develops meta-cognitive capabilities, allowing for increasingly subtle and comprehensive self-awareness.

In practical application, it manifests as regular practices of self-observation, reflection, and integration. These might include journaling, meditation, structured self-reflection, study of relevant knowledge, and active experimentation with insights. The quality develops through consistent application, moving from basic self-observation to increasingly subtle understanding of human nature and consciousness itself.

This universal description:
1. Maintains the depth of the original yogic concept while making it accessible
2. Preserves the systematic nature of the practice
3. Connects individual development to universal patterns
4. Emphasizes both theoretical and practical aspects
5. Shows clear developmental progression
6. Provides observable manifestations
7. Remains culturally neutral while maintaining sophistication

The description bridges:
- Individual and universal aspects
- Theory and practice
- Direct experience and reflected knowledge
- Personal development and universal patterns

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this description?
