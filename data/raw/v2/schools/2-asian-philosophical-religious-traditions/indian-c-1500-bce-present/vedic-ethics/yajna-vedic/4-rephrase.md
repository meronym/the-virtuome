Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Yajña:
Core principle: Sacred/transformative action that connects individual effort to larger purpose
Key functions: 
- Transformation of energy/intention
- Connection of individual to universal
- Maintenance of cosmic/social order
- Integration of daily life with higher purpose

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Giving/offering
- Purposeful action
- Self-transcendence
- Creative transformation
- Contributing to greater whole

Here's my attempt at the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to transform ordinary action into meaningful contribution through conscious offering and sacred intention. It represents the human ability to imbue activities with higher purpose, converting individual effort into universal value while maintaining awareness of one's role in larger systems of life.

[Essential Nature]
Sacred action represents a fundamental human capacity to bridge individual activity and universal purpose through intentional offering. It operates through the conscious transformation of energy and intention, where personal effort becomes meaningful contribution to the whole. This quality manifests as the ability to maintain awareness of larger purpose while engaging in specific actions, combining practical effectiveness with recognition of deeper significance.

More than mere technical action or symbolic ritual, it embodies the integration of purpose, awareness, and skillful offering that allows human activity to serve both immediate and ultimate aims. This creates a natural bridge between daily life and higher meaning, personal growth and universal good.

[Manifestations]
- Conscious intention and attention in action
- Skillful offering of effort/resources for greater good
- Recognition and maintenance of vital exchanges/relationships
- Integration of practical activity with higher purpose
- Transformation of individual action into universal contribution
- Development of sacred awareness in ordinary tasks
- Cultivation of generous and contributive attitude

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of attention and intention in action, combined with growing awareness of interconnection and exchange. It begins with recognition of how personal action affects larger wholes, evolves through conscious offering of effort and resources, and matures into natural sacred awareness in all activity. The process involves learning to maintain higher purpose while attending to practical details, transforming both the action and the actor.

In practical expression, this quality manifests as the ability to perform any worthy task with full attention, conscious purpose, and generous spirit. It creates natural excellence through the combination of technical skill and higher awareness, while fostering beneficial relationships through recognition of mutual exchange and contribution. This leads to actions that simultaneously serve immediate needs and universal good, maintaining both practical effectiveness and sacred significance.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? Yes - focuses on universal human capacity for meaningful action and contribution
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains transformative and connective aspects while avoiding religious specificity
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear connection to daily activities and personal development
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - explicitly addresses this relationship
5. Development clarity? Yes - shows progression from basic awareness to mature integration
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - listed in concrete, verifiable terms

The reformulation maintains the essential power of Yajña while making it accessible to contemporary understanding and practice. It preserves the sophisticated understanding of transformation and exchange while expressing it in universal human terms.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this reformulation?
