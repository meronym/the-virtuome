Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Dharma:
Core principle: Right ordering of action and being
Functions: Guides behavior, maintains order, enables growth
Systemic role: Integrates individual, social, and cosmic dimensions
Developmental aspects: Progressive understanding from external rules to internal wisdom

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences: Sense of rightness, role fulfillment, ethical intuition
Parallel concepts: Natural law, moral order, authentic action
Contemporary relevance: Personal integrity, professional ethics, social responsibility
Timeless patterns: Alignment of individual with greater order

3. STRUCTURAL IDENTIFICATION:
Primary Elements:
- Core: Alignment with natural/moral order
- Manifestation: Right action in context
- Development: External rules â†’ internal wisdom
- Relationships: Individual-collective-cosmic integration

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The innate capacity to recognize, align with, and embody right action in each situation, combining deep understanding of natural order with practical wisdom in daily life. This faculty integrates personal authenticity, social responsibility, and universal principles into coherent, life-supporting behavior.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the dynamic principle of right ordering in human experience - the capacity to recognize and actualize what is genuinely appropriate in each situation. It operates as an internal compass that integrates universal principles with contextual wisdom, enabling actions that simultaneously serve individual growth, social harmony, and larger natural orders.

It manifests as an evolving faculty that begins with learning established patterns and principles, develops through understanding their underlying wisdom, and matures into spontaneous recognition of right action. This development bridges external guidance and internal knowing, rules and wisdom, personal truth and universal order.

[Manifestations]
- Clear recognition of what each situation genuinely requires
- Natural alignment of personal action with larger purposes
- Spontaneous fulfillment of role responsibilities
- Integration of personal authenticity with social contribution
- Progressive refinement of ethical intuition
- Balance of steadfast principles with contextual wisdom
- Harmony between individual expression and collective good

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through three main stages: First, learning and following established patterns of right action; second, understanding the principles behind these patterns; and finally, developing direct recognition of what each moment requires. It operates by continuously integrating multiple levels of order - personal truth, social needs, and universal principles - into clear practical insight.

In daily life, it manifests as natural ethical fluency - the ability to navigate complex situations with actions that are simultaneously true to oneself, beneficial to others, and aligned with larger principles. It enables one to maintain integrity while adapting to circumstances, fulfilling responsibilities while growing personally, and contributing to collective good while honoring individual truth.
