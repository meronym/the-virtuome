Let me follow the process systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Satya:
Core principle: Alignment between reality, understanding, and expression
Functions: Verification, authenticity, honest communication, reality-testing
Systemic role: Creates trust, enables learning, maintains social cohesion
Developmental: Progresses from basic honesty to deeper authenticity to ultimate reality-recognition

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences: 
- Inner knowing vs. external expression
- Seeking/recognizing truth in complexity
- Building trust through consistency
- Desire for authentic self-expression

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Truth-recognition capacity
- Expression-reality alignment
- Progressive self-authenticity
- Reality-verification function

Secondary:
- Social trust-building
- Knowledge validation
- Ethical decision-making
- Personal integrity

Here's the universalized description following the requested format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, align with, and express truth across all dimensions of experience - from factual accuracy to personal authenticity to ultimate reality. It manifests as the dynamic alignment between inner knowing, outer expression, and objective reality, serving as both a perceptual faculty and an expressive discipline.

[Essential Nature]
Truth-alignment represents a fundamental human capacity operating at multiple levels simultaneously. At its core, it's the faculty that enables accurate perception of reality combined with the discipline of maintaining consistency between understanding and expression. This quality functions as both a receptive capacity (truth-recognition) and an active force (truth-expression).

It operates as an internal compass that continuously calibrates perception, understanding, and expression against reality itself. This creates a dynamic feedback loop where greater truth-recognition naturally leads to more authentic expression, which in turn enhances perceptual clarity.

[Manifestations]
- Accurate perception and description of objective reality
- Consistency between inner understanding and outer expression
- Recognition of deeper patterns and principles beneath surface appearances
- Spontaneous authenticity in self-expression and relationship
- Progressive refinement of understanding through reality-testing
- Natural building of trust through reliable truth-alignment
- Integration of different levels of truth (factual, personal, universal)

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through an iterative process of increasing alignment between perception, understanding, and expression. It begins with basic factual accuracy and expands to encompass emotional honesty, interpersonal authenticity, and recognition of deeper truths. The faculty strengthens through consistent exercise of both receptive discernment (distinguishing true from false) and active expression (maintaining alignment between understanding and communication).

In practical application, it manifests as natural trustworthiness, clear understanding, and authentic presence. It enables effective learning, genuine relationship, and reliable decision-making by maintaining continuous alignment with reality at all levels. This creates a foundation for both personal development and social cohesion, as shared truth-recognition enables collective understanding and coordinated action.

This universalized description:
- Preserves the depth of the Sanskrit concept
- Makes it accessible across cultures
- Maintains practical applicability
- Links individual to universal aspects
- Shows clear developmental trajectory
- Provides observable manifestations
- Retains philosophical sophistication
- Enables practical verification

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the objectives?
