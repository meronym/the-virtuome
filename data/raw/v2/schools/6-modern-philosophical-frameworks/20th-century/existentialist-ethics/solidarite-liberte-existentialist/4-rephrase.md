Let me follow the analytical process and then provide the universal formulation.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Mutual empowerment through recognition of shared freedom
Functions: 
- Supporting others' autonomy
- Building collective capacity
- Maintaining individual authenticity
- Creating sustainable communities

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Need for belonging while maintaining individuality
- Tension between personal and collective needs
- Desire to support others while respecting boundaries
- Search for authentic connection

Common patterns:
- Reciprocal growth through relationship
- Balanced interdependence
- Mutual enhancement of capability
- Collaborative empowerment

Here's the universal language formulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to support and enhance others' freedom while maintaining one's own, creating relationships and communities where individual authenticity and collective flourishing mutually reinforce each other. This quality enables genuine connection without compromise of personal integrity, fostering environments where everyone grows stronger through mutual recognition and support.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents a sophisticated balance between independence and interconnection, where supporting others' growth and maintaining personal authenticity become one unified movement. It manifests as the ability to create spaces and relationships where people become more fully themselves through their connections with others, rather than despite them.

At its heart lies the recognition that human freedom is not a zero-sum game but a mutually enhancing phenomenon - the more we support others' authentic development, the more we strengthen our own capacity for genuine self-expression and growth. This creates an upward spiral of collective empowerment through individual authenticity.

[Manifestations]
- Creating environments where others feel safe to express and explore their authentic selves
- Offering support that enhances rather than diminishes others' agency
- Maintaining personal boundaries while remaining genuinely connected
- Building relationships characterized by mutual growth and empowerment
- Fostering communities that strengthen individual uniqueness through collective support
- Balancing personal needs with genuine care for others' development
- Recognizing and actively supporting others' journeys of growth while continuing one's own

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay of recognition and support, where we actively strengthen others' capacity for authentic self-expression while remaining true to our own path. It requires constant attention to the delicate balance between giving space and offering support, between maintaining boundaries and creating connection. The development of this quality involves progressively expanding our capacity to hold both personal truth and genuine care for others' freedom simultaneously.

In practice, this manifests as the ability to create relationships and communities where people feel both completely free to be themselves and deeply supported in their growth. It shows up in how we offer help without creating dependency, how we express care without imposing our views, and how we build connections that make everyone involved stronger and more authentic. This quality transforms the apparent tension between individual and collective needs into a source of mutual enhancement.
```

This universal formulation:
1. Preserves the existentialist insight about freedom while making it accessible
2. Maintains practical relevance through concrete manifestations
3. Connects individual and collective dimensions
4. Describes observable behaviors and experiences
5. Shows clear developmental trajectory
6. Applies across cultural contexts while maintaining philosophical depth

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this formulation or elaborate on specific elements?
