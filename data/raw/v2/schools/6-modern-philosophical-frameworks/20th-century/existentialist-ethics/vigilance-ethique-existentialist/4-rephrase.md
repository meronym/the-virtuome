Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Continuous ethical awareness and reflection
Key functions:
- Maintaining moral consciousness
- Critical examination of choices
- Active value discernment
- Situational sensitivity
Systemic role: Enables authentic ethical action in absence of absolute values

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Moral uncertainty
- Need for ethical decision-making
- Consciousness of consequences
- Recognition of complexity
Contemporary applications:
- Digital ethics
- Environmental choices
- Professional decisions
- Social responsibility

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Now proceeding to compose the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain active ethical awareness and critical moral consciousness in daily life, combining careful attention to the consequences of one's choices with ongoing reflection about values and responsibilities. This quality enables thoughtful navigation of complex moral situations while remaining true to one's deepest principles.

[Essential Nature]
Ethical vigilance represents the dynamic intersection of awareness and moral responsibility, manifesting as an ever-present consciousness of the ethical dimension in human experience. Unlike rigid rule-following or occasional moral deliberation, it embodies a continuous state of ethical alertness and reflection. This quality combines keen situational awareness with deep consideration of values, consequences, and responsibilities.

This alertness operates across multiple dimensions - from immediate personal choices to broader social implications - while maintaining sensitivity to context, complexity, and the interconnected nature of ethical decisions. It enables one to recognize moral dimensions in seemingly ordinary situations and to maintain ethical consciousness even in challenging or ambiguous circumstances.

[Manifestations]
- Heightened awareness of ethical implications in daily choices
- Regular self-examination of motives and consequences
- Active consideration of others' perspectives and needs
- Careful attention to the ripple effects of decisions
- Continuous refinement of personal values through experience
- Recognition of moral complexity in seemingly simple situations
- Integration of ethical awareness into automatic responses

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the cultivation of both sensitivity and discernment. It begins with conscious effort to recognize ethical dimensions in everyday situations, gradually evolving into a more natural state of moral awareness. This development involves building capacity for nuanced perception, learning from experience, and maintaining ethical consciousness even under pressure or in routine situations. The quality strengthens through regular practice of reflection, honest self-examination, and careful consideration of consequences.

In practical application, ethical vigilance manifests as a consistent background awareness that informs both major decisions and subtle daily choices. It enables one to navigate complex situations with greater wisdom, recognize ethical implications before they become problems, and maintain integrity across varying contexts. This quality helps bridge the gap between abstract values and concrete actions, supporting both personal development and positive social impact.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: √ (focuses on universal human capacity for moral awareness)
2. Depth preservation: √ (maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language)
3. Practical applicability: √ (clear connection to daily decisions and actions)
4. Individual-universal connection: √ (links personal awareness to broader implications)
5. Development clarity: √ (describes both initial cultivation and ongoing refinement)
6. Observable manifestations: √ (concrete, verifiable expressions listed)

The description maintains the sophistication of the existentialist concept while making it accessible and applicable across cultural contexts. It preserves the core emphasis on active moral consciousness while connecting it to universal human experiences of ethical decision-making and moral development.
