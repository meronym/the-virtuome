Let me follow the process systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Self-congruent truthfulness in being and acting
Key functions:
- Self-recognition
- Freedom acknowledgment
- Genuine self-expression
- Reality confrontation
- Value creation

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Inner truth recognition
- Self-discovery journey
- Facing difficult truths
- Personal integrity challenges
- Creating genuine meaning

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Core: Alignment between inner truth and outer expression
- Manifestation: Conscious choice-making
- Development: From self-awareness to integrated being
- Relations: Self-to-self, self-to-reality, self-to-others

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The fundamental capacity to recognize, accept, and express one's true nature while maintaining conscious awareness of both complete freedom and full responsibility in creating one's life. It manifests as alignment between inner truth and outer action, sustained by ongoing self-examination and genuine self-expression.

[Essential Nature]
Authentic being emerges from the intersection of radical self-honesty and conscious self-creation. It requires simultaneously holding two truths: that we are completely free to create ourselves, and that this creation must arise from genuine self-recognition rather than external impositions or internal pretense. This quality develops through continuous dialogue between our deepest truth and our expressed reality, maintained by vigilant self-awareness and courageous self-expression.

This foundation of human development combines unflinching self-recognition with active self-creation, requiring both the courage to face uncomfortable truths and the creativity to forge genuine meaning. It serves as the basis for all other personal growth, enabling both individual flourishing and genuine connection with others.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent alignment between stated values and actual choices
- Capacity to recognize and acknowledge uncomfortable truths about oneself
- Natural self-expression that remains stable across different contexts
- Active resistance to self-deception and social pretense
- Genuine response to situations rather than scripted reactions
- Creative self-development guided by inner truth rather than external expectations
- Integration of past experiences into coherent but evolving self-narrative

[Functional Description]
Authentic being operates through a continuous cycle of recognition, acceptance, and expression. It begins with clear self-perception, moves through acceptance of what is seen (including uncomfortable truths), and culminates in genuine self-expression. This process requires maintaining awareness of both our complete freedom and our responsibility for self-creation, while resisting the tendency toward self-deception or social conformity.

In practice, this quality manifests as a distinctive combination of groundedness and flexibility. Those developing it exhibit increasing congruence between their inner reality and outer expression, while maintaining openness to growth and change. It enables both deep self-trust and genuine connection with others, creating a foundation for meaningful engagement with life's challenges and opportunities. Through its expression, individuals naturally influence others toward greater truthfulness and self-acceptance.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the existential depth while making it accessible
2. Maintains connection to universal human experience
3. Provides clear markers for development
4. Links individual experience to universal patterns
5. Offers practical manifestations
6. Retains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the objectives?
