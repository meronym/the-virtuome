Let me follow the process systematically for Responsabilité Radicale.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Total ownership of existence and its implications
Key functions: 
- Choice-consciousness
- Value creation
- Universal implication awareness
- Ethical self-determination
- Collective impact recognition

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Decision-making
- Impact awareness
- Consequence recognition
- Community influence
- Value creation

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to fully recognize and embrace how our choices and actions shape not just our own lives, but the shared human experience and future possibilities for all. This deep awareness transforms every decision into a conscious act of world-creation, acknowledging our role as shapers of collective reality.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the profound recognition that human beings are not merely passive participants in existence but active creators of meaning, values, and possibilities. It manifests as an ever-present awareness that each choice we make implicitly suggests a vision of what human life could or should be. This recognition doesn't paralyze but empowers, transforming everyday decisions into conscious acts of world-shaping.

The quality combines clear-sighted awareness with active engagement, acknowledging that even our attempts to avoid choosing are themselves choices that impact the collective human experience. It represents the point where individual freedom meets universal responsibility, where personal authenticity connects to collective destiny.

[Manifestations]
- Conscious deliberation before important choices, considering their wider implications
- Active engagement in value creation rather than passive acceptance of given values
- Recognition and acceptance of unintended consequences of one's actions
- Willingness to stand behind and learn from one's decisions
- Clear communication about one's role in shared outcomes
- Proactive consideration of how personal choices affect others
- Regular reflection on the broader impact of one's way of being

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a constant interplay between awareness and action. It begins with recognition of our inevitable role in shaping reality, develops through conscious engagement with choices and their implications, and matures into a natural integration of personal freedom with universal responsibility. The process involves increasingly sophisticated understanding of how individual choices ripple through the collective human experience.

In practical terms, this quality transforms daily life by bringing enhanced consciousness to decision-making at all levels. From personal habits to professional choices to social engagement, it manifests as a continuous awareness of how each action contributes to the collective human story. This awareness doesn't burden but enriches, making each moment an opportunity for meaningful participation in the ongoing creation of human reality.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: ✓ (focuses on universal human experience of choice and impact)
2. Depth preservation: ✓ (maintains existentialist insights while making them accessible)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear connections to daily decision-making)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (explicitly links personal choices to collective impact)
5. Development clarity: ✓ (shows progression from awareness to integration)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (concrete, verifiable expressions provided)

This universal language version maintains the philosophical sophistication of the existentialist concept while making it accessible and practical for contemporary application across cultures. It preserves the core insights about freedom, responsibility, and collective impact while expressing them in experiential rather than theoretical terms.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
