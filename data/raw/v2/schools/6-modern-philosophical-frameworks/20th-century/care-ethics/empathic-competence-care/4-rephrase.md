Let me follow the process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Empathic Competence:

Core principle: Integration of emotional understanding with practical capability
Key functions:
- Emotional resonance with others
- Skilled response to needs
- Balance of feeling and action
- Effective care delivery
- Developmental support

Relationship patterns:
- Bidirectional awareness
- Practical-emotional feedback loops
- Professional-personal integration
- Care provider-recipient dynamics

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Understanding others' needs
- Developing practical skills
- Combining heart and hands
- Growing through experience
- Balancing feeling and doing

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Synchronized feeling-action capability
- Progressive skill development
- Integration of understanding and execution
- Balanced care delivery

Secondary:
- Technical-emotional balance
- Practice-based learning
- Relationship cultivation
- Practical wisdom development

Here's the universalized description following the requested format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The integrated capacity to understand others' experiences deeply while responding effectively to their needs, combining emotional insight with practical skill. This quality enables both accurate perception of others' situations and competent action to support their wellbeing, developing through experience and conscious practice.

[Essential Nature]
Empathic competence represents the synthesis of emotional understanding and practical capability, transcending the traditional division between feeling and doing. It manifests as a dynamic balance between receptive awareness and effective action, allowing for both deep connection with others and skillful response to their needs. This quality evolves through experience, reflection, and practiced engagement, becoming increasingly refined and intuitive over time.

At its core, it embodies the integration of heart and hands â€“ the ability to both resonate with others' experiences and respond effectively to their situations. This dual capacity ensures that care is both genuinely attuned and practically beneficial, avoiding the pitfalls of either detached capability or ineffective empathy.

[Manifestations]
- Accurate recognition of others' needs combined with effective response
- Balanced integration of emotional awareness and practical action
- Progressive refinement of both understanding and skill through experience
- Adaptive response patterns that match situation requirements
- Seamless flow between perception and appropriate action
- Development of intuitive expertise in human care
- Creation of trust through demonstrated understanding and capability

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through continuous interplay between emotional resonance and practical response, each aspect informing and enhancing the other. As understanding deepens, action becomes more precise; as capability grows, perception becomes more nuanced. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle of development, where each experience contributes to greater integration of feeling and doing.

In practice, empathic competence enables increasingly sophisticated care interactions, where understanding others' needs and responding effectively become a unified process. This integration manifests in fluid, appropriate responses that address both immediate situations and underlying needs, while fostering growth and development in all participants. The quality becomes evident in the natural ease with which complex care situations are navigated and positive outcomes achieved.

This universalized description aims to:
- Capture the essence without culture-specific references
- Maintain philosophical depth while ensuring accessibility
- Connect individual experience to universal patterns
- Provide clear developmental pathway understanding
- Enable practical application across contexts
- Preserve the sophisticated integration central to the concept

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universalization?
