Let me first analyze the concept following our preparation framework before composing the universal description.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:

Core Principle:
- The quality of being present and engaged in ways that actively support growth and development in others
- Combines active attention with developmental support

Key Functions:
1. Sustained attentional engagement
2. Growth facilitation
3. Emotional containment
4. Developmental support
5. Authentic connection

Relationship Patterns:
- Bidirectional influence
- Developmental asymmetry
- Mutual growth potential
- Dynamic responsiveness

Developmental Aspects:
- Progresses from basic presence to skilled facilitation
- Develops through practice and self-awareness
- Requires emotional maturity
- Builds on experiential learning

UNIVERSALIZATION:

Universal Experiences:
- Parent-child relationships
- Mentorship
- Teaching/learning
- Personal growth support
- Healing relationships

Parallel Concepts:
- Therapeutic presence
- Mindful attention
- Developmental support
- Growth facilitation
- Holding space

Here's the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to be authentically present with others in a way that actively supports their growth and development while maintaining genuine emotional availability. It combines sustained attention with the ability to create conditions conducive to another's flourishing, operating through both conscious engagement and subtle influence.

[Essential Nature]
Nurturing presence manifests as a quality of engaged awareness that creates space for growth while actively supporting development. It transcends mere physical presence by combining emotional availability with developmental wisdom. This quality emerges from the integration of sustained attention, authentic engagement, and the ability to recognize and respond to growth opportunities in others.

The essence of this quality lies in its dual nature: maintaining genuine presence while actively contributing to another's development. It requires both receptivity and active engagement, operating through moment-to-moment awareness while maintaining a broader developmental perspective.

[Manifestations]
- Sustained attention combined with emotional availability
- Creation of safe spaces for growth and exploration
- Responsive engagement that adapts to developmental needs
- Balance between active support and allowing autonomous development
- Recognition and cultivation of growth opportunities
- Authentic emotional presence without overwhelming or withdrawing
- Maintenance of development-supporting boundaries

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through multiple channels simultaneously: conscious attention, emotional attunement, and developmental wisdom. It functions by creating an interpersonal field that supports growth while maintaining authentic connection. The practice involves continual calibration between active engagement and receptive presence, guided by an understanding of developmental needs and opportunities.

In practical expression, nurturing presence manifests in relationships where growth and development are central: parenting, teaching, mentoring, healing, and leadership. It shows in the ability to maintain genuine emotional availability while actively supporting another's development through both direct engagement and subtle influences. Success appears in the observable growth and increased capability of those receiving this quality of presence.

This universalized description:
1. Maintains the sophisticated understanding from Care Ethics
2. Connects to universal human experiences
3. Remains practically applicable
4. Preserves developmental aspects
5. Identifies observable manifestations
6. Links individual and universal dimensions

The description avoids culture-specific references while maintaining the depth of the original concept, making it accessible across cultural contexts while preserving its essential sophistication.

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universalization?
