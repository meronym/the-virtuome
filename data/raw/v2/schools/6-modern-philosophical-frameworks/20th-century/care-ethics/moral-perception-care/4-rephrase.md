Let me analyze and transform the Care Ethics concept of Moral Perception following our framework.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: The capacity to recognize moral dimensions in situations
Key functions: 
- Recognition of ethical significance
- Understanding of relational impacts
- Awareness of care needs
- Integration of emotional and rational perception

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Sensing others' needs/suffering
- Recognizing responsibility moments
- Feeling moral weight of situations
- Intuiting right action

STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Recognition capacity
- Integrative awareness
- Situational understanding
- Responsibility sensing

Secondary:
- Emotional-rational balance
- Contextual sensitivity
- Action guidance
- Relational awareness

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The innate human capacity to recognize and understand the moral dimension of life situations, combining emotional sensitivity with practical understanding to perceive ethical significance, relational impacts, and opportunities for beneficial action in daily experience.

[Essential Nature]
Moral perception operates as an integrated form of awareness that combines emotional sensitivity, rational understanding, and practical insight. It functions as a bridge between raw experience and ethical action, allowing us to recognize moments of moral significance within the flow of ordinary life. This perceptual capacity develops through experience and reflection, becoming increasingly refined in its ability to detect subtle ethical dimensions and implications.

Like any perceptual ability, it involves both immediate recognition and deeper understanding, operating at multiple levels from instant intuition to considered reflection. It serves as the foundation for ethical action by illuminating opportunities for positive impact and revealing the web of moral relationships in which we exist.

[Manifestations]
- Immediate recognition of situations requiring ethical response
- Sensitive awareness of others' needs and vulnerabilities
- Clear perception of relationship dynamics and their moral implications
- Recognition of responsibility moments in daily life
- Understanding of how actions affect others' wellbeing
- Capacity to detect subtle ethical dimensions in ordinary situations
- Integration of emotional signals with rational understanding

[Functional Description]
Moral perception develops through an interplay of experience, reflection, and practice. It begins with basic emotional sensitivity to others' needs and gradually expands to include more sophisticated understanding of ethical dimensions and implications. This capacity becomes more refined through conscious attention to moral aspects of experience, reflection on past situations, and integration of emotional and rational insights.

In practical terms, moral perception enables us to navigate daily life with greater awareness of our impact on others and opportunities for positive action. It helps us recognize moments of ethical significance that might otherwise pass unnoticed, guides us in understanding the needs of others, and supports us in making choices that contribute to individual and collective wellbeing. This capacity serves as an essential foundation for ethical behavior by bridging the gap between abstract moral understanding and concrete situational awareness.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: Uses universal human experiences of perception and relationship
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language
3. Practical applicability: Links to concrete situations and observable behaviors
4. Individual-Universal connection: Shows how personal capacity serves broader ethical awareness
5. Developmental clarity: Describes growth process from basic to refined perception
6. Observable manifestations: Lists concrete expressions that can be recognized and verified

The description avoids culture-specific terminology while preserving the sophisticated understanding developed in Care Ethics. It emphasizes universal human experiences of moral recognition and relationship awareness, making it accessible across cultural contexts while maintaining practical relevance.
