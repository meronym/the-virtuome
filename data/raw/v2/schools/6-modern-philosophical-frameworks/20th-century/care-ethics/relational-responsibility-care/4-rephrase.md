Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Relational Responsibility:

Core Principle:
- Recognition and active engagement with web of moral obligations arising from human interconnectedness

Key Functions:
- Awareness of interdependence
- Recognition of mutual obligations
- Active maintenance of care networks
- Balancing multiple responsibilities
- Integration of personal and collective duties

Universal Human Experiences:
- Dependency relationships
- Community membership
- Family bonds
- Social obligations
- Mutual support networks

Based on this analysis, here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, accept, and actively engage with the web of mutual obligations and dependencies that arise from our fundamental interconnectedness as human beings. It manifests as a deep awareness of how our actions affect others and a committed response to the responsibilities inherent in our relationships.

[Essential Nature]
Relational responsibility emerges from the basic human experience of interconnectedness - the reality that no person exists or thrives in isolation. It represents the mature understanding that our lives are inherently intertwined with others through complex networks of dependency, influence, and mutual support. This quality transforms abstract awareness of connection into active engagement with the obligations and opportunities that arise from our relationships.

Unlike simple duty or obligation, relational responsibility integrates emotional awareness with practical commitment, personal agency with collective consciousness, and immediate care with broader social engagement. It develops through experiencing both giving and receiving care, recognizing mutual vulnerability, and understanding the ripple effects of our actions through social networks.

[Manifestations]
- Active awareness of how one's actions affect others in both immediate and extended circles
- Balanced attention to multiple relationships and their varying needs
- Practical support and care for those in one's sphere of influence
- Recognition and acceptance of both receiving and giving care
- Integration of personal needs with collective responsibilities
- Sustained commitment to maintaining healthy relationship networks
- Development of systems and practices that support mutual care

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through continuous cycles of awareness, recognition, and response. It begins with heightened perception of relationship patterns and their associated needs, develops through practical engagement with responsibilities, and matures into skilled navigation of complex social obligations. The development process involves growing awareness of interdependence, increasing capacity to balance multiple commitments, and deepening understanding of how individual actions affect collective wellbeing.

In practice, relational responsibility manifests as reliable presence in relationships, thoughtful consideration of how choices affect others, and active participation in networks of mutual support. It enables individuals to maintain healthy boundaries while remaining genuinely engaged with others' needs, to balance personal growth with collective wellbeing, and to contribute meaningfully to the social fabric while receiving necessary support from it. This quality is essential for building sustainable communities, maintaining healthy relationships, and creating systems that support human flourishing.
