Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Wertnehmung:
Core principle: Direct perception/recognition of values/worth
Key functions: 
- Moral sensitivity
- Value recognition
- Intuitive understanding
- Evaluative perception
Systemic role: Foundation for ethical action and judgment

2. UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Sensing rightness/wrongness
- Feeling moral weight of situations
- Recognizing worth/importance
- Intuitive ethical understanding

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary: Value-sensing capacity leading to ethical insight
Secondary: Requires cultivation of sensitivity and attention

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to directly recognize worth, value, and moral significance in experiences, situations, and actions. This fundamental perceptual ability combines emotional sensitivity with intuitive understanding, enabling us to grasp the ethical dimension of reality through direct experience rather than abstract reasoning.

[Essential Nature]
Value-recognition represents our innate capacity to sense and understand what matters, what has worth, and what carries moral weight in our experience. Like our ability to perceive colors or sounds, this faculty allows direct contact with the dimension of value and meaning in reality. It operates through a combination of emotional resonance, intuitive understanding, and refined attention, developing through experience and cultivation.

This capacity differs from logical reasoning about ethics or merely following rules. Instead, it represents a direct, experiential understanding of significance and worth, similar to how we immediately recognize beauty or grasp the emotional state of another person.

[Manifestations]
- Immediate recognition of ethical significance in situations
- Refined sensitivity to moral nuance and complexity
- Intuitive grasp of what matters in human experience
- Direct perception of worth and value in people, actions, and choices
- Clear recognition of ethical demands in concrete situations
- Emotional attunement to moral dimensions of experience

[Functional Description]
Value-recognition operates through a synthesis of emotional sensitivity, perceptual awareness, and intuitive understanding. Like learning to appreciate music or art, this capacity develops through attention and experience, becoming progressively more refined and nuanced. It requires maintaining an open, receptive attitude while engaging actively with the moral dimension of experience.

In practice, this faculty enables rapid recognition of ethical significance in daily situations, guides decision-making through direct understanding rather than rule-following, and supports authentic moral response. It manifests in the immediate sense of what matters in a situation, the recognition of human dignity, and the capacity to discern genuine worth from superficial appeal.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural? Yes - based on universal human capacity for value recognition
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible
3. Practically applicable? Yes - connects to everyday experience and decision-making
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal capacity to universal human experience
5. Development clear? Yes - describes progressive refinement through experience
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - listed concrete expressions and practical impacts

The description maintains the philosophical sophistication of the original phenomenological concept while making it accessible through universal human experiences and practical manifestations. It preserves the essential insight about direct value-perception while avoiding culture-specific terminology or overly abstract concepts.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
