[Core Definition]
The capacity to directly recognize worth, value, and moral significance in experiences, situations, and actions. This fundamental perceptual ability combines emotional sensitivity with intuitive understanding, enabling us to grasp the ethical dimension of reality through direct experience rather than abstract reasoning.

[Essential Nature]
Value-recognition represents our innate capacity to sense and understand what matters, what has worth, and what carries moral weight in our experience. Like our ability to perceive colors or sounds, this faculty allows direct contact with the dimension of value and meaning in reality. It operates through a combination of emotional resonance, intuitive understanding, and refined attention, developing through experience and cultivation.

This capacity differs from logical reasoning about ethics or merely following rules. Instead, it represents a direct, experiential understanding of significance and worth, similar to how we immediately recognize beauty or grasp the emotional state of another person.

[Manifestations]
- Immediate recognition of ethical significance in situations
- Refined sensitivity to moral nuance and complexity
- Intuitive grasp of what matters in human experience
- Direct perception of worth and value in people, actions, and choices
- Clear recognition of ethical demands in concrete situations
- Emotional attunement to moral dimensions of experience

[Functional Description]
Value-recognition operates through a synthesis of emotional sensitivity, perceptual awareness, and intuitive understanding. Like learning to appreciate music or art, this capacity develops through attention and experience, becoming progressively more refined and nuanced. It requires maintaining an open, receptive attitude while engaging actively with the moral dimension of experience.

In practice, this faculty enables rapid recognition of ethical significance in daily situations, guides decision-making through direct understanding rather than rule-following, and supports authentic moral response. It manifests in the immediate sense of what matters in a situation, the recognition of human dignity, and the capacity to discern genuine worth from superficial appeal.
