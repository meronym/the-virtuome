Initial Concept Analysis\n- Identify the virtue's core principle/phenomenon\n- List key functions and manifestations\n- Note relationship patterns and systemic roles\n- Map developmental aspects\n\n2. Universalization Process\n- Identify universal human experiences it relates to\n- Find parallel concepts across contexts\n- Note contemporary relevance/applications\n- Identify timeless patterns/principles\n\n3. Structural Analysis\nPrimary Elements:\n- Essential nature/core function\n- Observable manifestations\n- Developmental trajectory\n- Systemic relationships\n\nSecondary Elements:\n- Common obstacles/challenges\n- Supporting conditions\n- Related qualities\n- Practical applications\n\nCOMPOSITION GUIDELINES:\n1. Language:\n- Use phenomenological rather than theoretical language\n- Prefer experiential descriptions over abstract concepts\n- Balance precision with accessibility\n- Avoid culture-specific references\n\n2. Structure:\n- Start with clearest, most fundamental aspect\n- Build complexity progressively\n- Connect abstract principles to concrete manifestations\n- Link individual to universal aspects\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```markdown\n[Core Definition]\nSingle paragraph capturing fundamental essence\n(50-75 words)\n\n[Essential Nature]\nDeeper elaboration of the quality's nature and function\n(100-150 words)\n\n[Manifestations]\n- Observable expressions (4-7 bullet points)\n- Developmental aspects\n- Practical implementations\n- Relationship patterns\n\n[Functional Description]\nHow this quality operates and develops in human experience\nTwo paragraphs:\n1. Operation/mechanism (75-100 words)\n2. Practical expression/impact (75-100 words)\n```\n\nQUALITY CRITERIA:\n1. Comprehensiveness:\n- Captures full depth of original concept\n- Addresses multiple dimensions (personal/interpersonal/universal)\n- Includes both theoretical and practical aspects\n\n2. Accessibility:\n- Understandable without specialized knowledge\n- Relatable to common experience\n- Practical and applicable\n\n3. Precision:\n- Clear differentiation from related concepts\n- Specific rather than vague descriptions\n- Accurate to original meaning\n\n4. Relevance:\n- Contemporary applications clear\n- Universal human significance evident\n- Practical value apparent\n\nVERIFICATION QUESTIONS:\n1. Would this description be meaningful across cultures?\n2. Does it preserve the depth of the original concept?\n3. Is it practically applicable?\n4. Does it connect individual to universal aspects?\n5. Is it clear how this quality develops?\n6. Are the manifestations observable/verifiable?\n\nUPDATED SCOPE: Please focus on the following virtue: Dialogische Vortrefflichkeit. Follow the provided preparation instructions, composition guidelines, and output format to create a universal language description of the virtue."
