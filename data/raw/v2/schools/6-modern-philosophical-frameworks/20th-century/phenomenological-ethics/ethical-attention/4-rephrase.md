Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Achtsamkeit:
Core principle: Sustained ethical perceptiveness
Key functions: 
- Moral situation awareness
- Recognition of ethical dimensions
- Sustained attentional presence
- Integration of perception and response
Systemic role: Foundation for ethical recognition and response

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Recognizing importance in moments
- Sensing when something matters
- Maintaining awareness of consequences
- Feeling ethical weight of situations

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS identified and organized.

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
Ethical Presence

[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain vivid awareness of the moral dimension in everyday experience, combining sustained attention to what matters with sensitive recognition of ethical qualities and implications in situations as they unfold. This awareness integrates perception, feeling, and understanding while remaining open to full situational complexity.

[Essential Nature]
Ethical presence operates as a fundamental perceptual-cognitive-affective capacity that illuminates the moral dimension of human experience. Unlike routine attention or general mindfulness, it specifically attunes to the ethical weight and implications present in each moment and situation. This quality combines the immediacy of direct perception with the depth of moral recognition, maintaining careful balance between focused awareness and open receptivity.

This attunement operates simultaneously at multiple levels: recognizing explicit ethical elements, sensing subtle moral implications, and maintaining awareness of broader consequences and connections. It serves as a foundation for moral wisdom by keeping ethical significance continuously available to consciousness without forcing or straining.

[Manifestations]
- Sustained recognition of moral significance in everyday situations
- Sensitive attunement to ethical implications of actions and choices
- Balanced awareness that neither overlooks nor overemphasizes moral elements
- Natural recognition of what deserves ethical attention or response
- Integration of cognitive understanding with felt moral significance
- Maintained ethical awareness without tension or forced effort
- Development of increasingly subtle moral perception over time

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive refinement of natural moral sensitivity combined with cultivated attention. Initially emerging as periodic recognition of obvious ethical moments, it gradually matures into sustained background awareness that naturally highlights moral significance without losing touch with practical reality. This development integrates increasingly subtle perception with growing capacity for sustained, effortless ethical attention.

In practice, ethical presence enables recognition of moral dimensions that might otherwise be overlooked while preventing ethical awareness from becoming heavy or burdensome. It supports both immediate moral perception and longer-term ethical development by maintaining constant gentle contact with the ethical dimension of experience. This creates a foundation for wise action by ensuring that moral significance remains available to consciousness without dominating it.

This universalized description aims to:
- Preserve the phenomenological sophistication of Achtsamkeit
- Make it accessible across cultural contexts
- Maintain practical applicability
- Connect individual experience to universal patterns
- Detail observable manifestations
- Clarify development patterns

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Uses universal human experiences of attention and recognition
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding of attention/awareness
3. Practical applicability: Clear connections to everyday experience
4. Individual-universal connection: Links personal capacity to universal patterns
5. Development clarity: Shows progression from basic to refined
6. Observable manifestations: Listed in concrete, verifiable terms

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
