Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Verantwortung:
Core principle: Active ethical response-ability
Functions: Awareness, accountability, agency, response
Systemic role: Links perception to action, bridges individual-collective
Developmental: Progresses from basic accountability to radical ethical presence

2. UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences: Decision-making, consequence awareness, moral agency
Parallel concepts: Stewardship, guardianship, ethical agency
Contemporary relevance: Environmental crisis, technological ethics, social justice
Timeless patterns: Choice-consequence relationship, ethical agency, moral courage

Here's the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The fundamental capacity to recognize, own, and actively respond to the ethical demands of existence. It combines clear awareness of moral agency with the practical ability to act effectively, while fully embracing the consequences of one's choices and their ripple effects through the web of life.

[Essential Nature]
Responsive responsibility emerges from the intersection of awareness, agency, and action. It manifests as an ever-present readiness to meet life's ethical demands with full presence and considered response. Unlike simple accountability, it represents an active stance of ethical engagement that recognizes both the power to affect change and the obligation to act wisely. This quality develops through increasingly subtle recognition of interconnection and increasingly skilled capacity for effective response.

[Manifestations]
- Clear recognition of choice points and their implications
- Active engagement with ethical demands rather than passive compliance
- Skilled navigation of complex moral situations
- Integration of personal agency with collective impact awareness
- Progressive expansion from immediate to universal concern
- Development of practical wisdom in ethical response
- Cultivation of both response-ability and accountability

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay of awareness and action. It begins with recognition of ethical demands and personal agency, develops through conscious engagement with choices and consequences, and matures into skilled ethical response. The capacity grows through progressive integration of perception, judgment, and action, supported by deepening understanding of interconnection.

In practice, it manifests as a characteristic stance of ethical readiness combined with practical effectiveness. This ranges from basic ownership of personal choices to radical responsibility for collective flourishing. It enables both immediate practical response to ethical demands and long-term cultivation of moral wisdom, expressing itself through increasingly skillful navigation of complex ethical territories while maintaining full awareness of universal implications.

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural? Yes - focuses on universal human experiences of choice and consequence
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear connection to everyday ethical decisions
4. Individual-Universal? Yes - links personal agency to collective impact
5. Development clear? Yes - shows progression from basic to advanced manifestations
6. Observable? Yes - specific behavioral and attitudinal markers provided

The reformulation maintains the phenomenological emphasis on direct experience while making the concept accessible across cultural contexts. It preserves the sophisticated understanding of responsibility developed in phenomenological ethics while expressing it in universal terms related to common human experience.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this reformulation?
