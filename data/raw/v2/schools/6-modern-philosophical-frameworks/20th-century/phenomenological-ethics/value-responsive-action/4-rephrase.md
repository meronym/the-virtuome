Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Wertantwort:
Core principle: Active response-capacity to recognized values
Key functions: 
- Bridges perception and action
- Translates value-recognition into practical response
- Integrates understanding with implementation
- Maintains ethical authenticity in action

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Feeling called to act on recognized truth/good
- Knowing what's right and implementing it
- Translating insight into action
- Responding effectively to moral situations

SYNTHESIS ATTEMPT:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Value-responsive action is the capacity to translate recognized worth into effective deed, bridging the gap between moral insight and practical implementation. It combines sensitive awareness of what matters with the skill to respond appropriately, manifesting values through concrete action in ways that honor both the situation's demands and universal principles.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the dynamic bridge between perception and action in ethical life. Unlike mere moral knowledge or good intentions, it embodies the active capacity to manifest recognized values in concrete situations. It operates as an integrated form of practical wisdom that combines three elements: clear recognition of what matters in a situation, understanding of appropriate response patterns, and the practical skill to implement effective action.

The quality develops through repeated cycles of recognition, response, and reflection, gradually building a repertoire of ethical expertise that becomes increasingly refined and spontaneous. It manifests as a kind of ethical fluency, where appropriate response flows naturally from clear perception.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous appropriate response to ethical situations
- Skillful translation of values into practical action
- Fluid integration of perception and response
- Natural alignment of action with recognized worth
- Effective implementation of moral insights
- Practical wisdom in ethical decision-making
- Authentic expression of values through behavior

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay between receptive awareness and active response. When fully developed, it functions as an integrated capacity where recognition of value immediately illuminates appropriate action possibilities. The process involves constant calibration between universal principles and particular situations, maintaining authenticity while adapting to specific contexts. Rather than following rules, it expresses a kind of ethical expertise that knows how to respond appropriately to each unique situation.

In practice, this manifests as a form of ethical fluency where appropriate response becomes increasingly natural and spontaneous. The individual develops a refined capacity to read situations accurately and respond effectively, similar to how a skilled artist or craftsperson knows exactly how to achieve their intended result. This practical wisdom enables effective ethical action even in complex or challenging circumstances, maintaining integrity while adapting to specific demands.
