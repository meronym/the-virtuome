Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Critical Discernment:

Core Principle: The capacity to perceive, evaluate, and understand with clarity and wisdom
Key Functions:
- Separating truth from falsehood
- Evaluating quality and validity
- Recognizing patterns and implications
- Integrating multiple perspectives
- Making sound judgments

2. UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal Experiences:
- Navigating complexity
- Making choices under uncertainty
- Learning from experience
- Recognizing truth/authenticity
- Avoiding deception/confusion

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary Elements:
- Clear perception
- Evaluative capacity
- Pattern recognition
- Wisdom integration
- Practical application

Here's the universalized description following the requested format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to see clearly into the nature of things, distinguishing truth from falsehood, essence from appearance, and wisdom from mere knowledge. It combines sharp perception with deep understanding, enabling sound judgment in both simple and complex situations.

[Essential Nature]
Critical discernment operates as an integrative capacity of human consciousness that combines clear perception with deep understanding. It functions as both a protective filter against falsehood and a positive faculty for recognizing truth and value. Unlike mere analytical thinking, it encompasses both intellectual and intuitive dimensions, drawing on both reasoned evaluation and experiential wisdom. This quality enables one to navigate complexity while maintaining connection to fundamental truths and values.

[Manifestations]
- Clear recognition of truth and authenticity in information, people, and situations
- Ability to detect inconsistencies, hidden patterns, and underlying meanings
- Balanced evaluation that considers multiple perspectives without losing center
- Natural resistance to deception, manipulation, and false appearances
- Growing capacity to recognize higher-order patterns and principles
- Development of refined taste and judgment in chosen domains
- Integration of analytical precision with intuitive wisdom

[Functional Description]
Critical discernment develops through the progressive refinement of both perception and understanding. It begins with basic pattern recognition and grows through experience, reflection, and conscious practice. Each encounter with complexity or challenge serves to sharpen this faculty, while each instance of successful discernment strengthens the foundation for future understanding. The quality becomes more subtle and comprehensive over time, moving from simple discrimination to nuanced wisdom.

In practical application, critical discernment manifests as a natural clarity in facing choices and challenges. It enables one to quickly recognize truth from falsehood, authentic from artificial, and wisdom from mere cleverness. This capacity proves essential in navigating information, relationships, and decisions, serving as both protective filter and guiding light. It combines intellectual rigor with intuitive wisdom, allowing for both precise analysis and holistic understanding.

This universalization:
1. Maintains the essence of critical discernment while making it accessible
2. Connects individual experience to universal patterns
3. Preserves both practical and philosophical dimensions
4. Provides clear developmental trajectory
5. Offers observable manifestations
6. Links to common human experience

The description should be meaningful across cultures while preserving the depth of the original virtue ethics concept. It emphasizes both personal development and practical application, connecting individual capacity to universal wisdom.

Would you like me to:
1. Further elaborate any aspect?
2. Provide specific examples of manifestations?
3. Develop practical exercises for cultivation?
4. Explore relationships with other virtues?
