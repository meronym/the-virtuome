Let me follow the preparation steps first:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Authenticity:
Core principle: Alignment between inner truth and outer expression
Key functions: Self-knowledge, genuine expression, ethical congruence
Relationship patterns: Self-to-self, self-to-others, self-to-values
Developmental aspects: Growing self-awareness, increasing integration, ethical maturation

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Inner sense of truth/falseness
- Desire for genuine expression
- Tension between social roles and inner self
- Search for meaning/identity
- Need for consistent self-narrative

Parallel concepts:
- Personal truth
- Genuine presence
- Self-integrity
- Congruence
- Inner harmony

Now, the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to know, honor, and express one's genuine nature while maintaining ethical relationship with reality. It manifests as the dynamic alignment between inner truth and outer expression, enabling coherent and meaningful engagement with life, others, and oneself.

[Essential Nature]
Authenticity emerges from the fundamental human capacity to sense and align with inner truth. It operates as an integrative force, harmonizing different aspects of experience - thoughts, feelings, actions, and relationships - into a coherent whole. This quality enables both deep self-knowledge and genuine external expression, creating a bridge between internal reality and external engagement.

Unlike simple self-expression, authenticity includes an ethical dimension - a commitment to truth that extends beyond personal preference to encompass responsibility toward reality itself. It requires ongoing dialogue between personal truth and universal principles, between individual expression and relational responsibility.

[Manifestations]
- Clear sense of personal truth distinct from adopted beliefs or social conditioning
- Natural congruence between inner experience and outer expression
- Capacity to maintain genuine presence even in challenging situations
- Integration of different life roles without loss of essential integrity
- Ethical consistency emerging from genuine self-knowledge rather than imposed rules
- Development of unique, authentic voice/way of being while respecting universal principles
- Growing ability to foster authentic connections and relationships

[Functional Description]
Authenticity operates through a continuous process of inner attention, recognition, and alignment. It begins with the capacity to sense internal truth - distinguishing genuine impulses from conditioned responses, real values from adopted ones. This recognition develops into an integrative force, gradually bringing different aspects of life into harmony with core truth. The process involves both discovery and creation - uncovering what is genuinely true while actively shaping its expression.

In practical terms, authenticity manifests as increasing congruence between inner and outer life. It enables clear, genuine communication, meaningful relationships, and ethical decision-making rooted in real understanding rather than rules. This quality creates natural authority in one's life and work, as actions flow from genuine understanding rather than external pressure. The authentic person becomes a unique expression of universal principles, embodying truth in their own particular way.

This description aims to:
1. Capture the philosophical depth of modern virtue ethics' concept of authenticity
2. Make it accessible through universal human experiences
3. Maintain practical relevance
4. Connect individual to universal aspects
5. Show clear developmental trajectory
6. Provide observable manifestations

Would you like me to:
1. Adjust any aspect of the description?
2. Elaborate on specific elements?
3. Add more practical examples?
4. Develop the developmental trajectory further?
