Let me analyze Ecological Wisdom following the framework.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
- Core: Integration of environmental understanding with ethical action
- Functions: Guides sustainable behavior, informs systemic decisions, promotes harmony with nature
- Relationships: Links individual choices to global impacts, connects present actions to future outcomes
- Development: Progresses from basic awareness to systemic understanding to integrated wisdom

UNIVERSALIZATION:
- Universal experiences: Living within natural systems, observing cycles, experiencing interdependence
- Parallel concepts: Harmony with nature, sustainable living, responsible stewardship
- Contemporary relevance: Environmental crisis, sustainability challenges, ecological restoration
- Timeless patterns: Natural cycles, ecosystem relationships, resource management

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to understand, value, and act in harmony with the living systems that sustain life, combining deep awareness of natural patterns with practical wisdom in navigating human-environment relationships. This quality enables conscious participation in the web of life while promoting its health and resilience.

[Essential Nature]
Ecological wisdom emerges from the fundamental human experience of being embedded within living systems. It represents the marriage of careful observation and ethical responsibility, developed through direct engagement with natural processes and refined through practical experience. This quality transcends mere environmental knowledge, manifesting as an integrated understanding that informs action, shapes values, and guides decision-making across scales.

This wisdom encompasses both the cognitive grasp of ecological principles and the experiential understanding of how human actions ripple through natural systems. It involves recognizing patterns, understanding consequences, and developing the capacity to act in ways that support rather than diminish the vitality of living systems.

[Manifestations]
- Heightened awareness of natural patterns, cycles, and relationships
- Conscious consideration of long-term and systemic impacts in decision-making
- Practical skills in sustainable living and resource management
- Capacity to recognize and respond to environmental feedback
- Development of mutually beneficial relationships with natural systems
- Integration of ecological understanding into daily choices and actions
- Recognition of human dependence on and responsibility to natural systems

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive deepening of both understanding and engagement with natural systems. It begins with basic awareness and appreciation, grows through observation and experience, and matures into integrated wisdom that shapes behavior and decision-making. The development process involves increasingly sophisticated pattern recognition, growing systemic awareness, and expanding circles of consideration in time and space.

In practical expression, ecological wisdom manifests as the capacity to make decisions that account for environmental impacts across scales and timeframes. It enables individuals and groups to navigate complex environmental challenges, make sustainable choices, and contribute to ecological health. This wisdom shapes everything from personal lifestyle choices to organizational policies to societal priorities, promoting actions that enhance rather than degrade the living systems that sustain us.
