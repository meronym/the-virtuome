```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to learn deeply from experience through conscious examination of thoughts, actions, and outcomes, leading to increasingly refined understanding and decision-making. This quality enables the transformation of raw experience into practical wisdom through intentional reflection and integration.

[Essential Nature]
Reflective judgment operates as an internal integrating function that transforms experience into understanding through conscious examination. It combines careful observation of outcomes, honest self-assessment, and the ability to extract meaningful patterns from experience. Unlike simple retrospection, it actively processes experience through multiple lenses - emotional, practical, and philosophical - to derive deeper insights and principles for future action.

This quality serves as a bridge between experience and wisdom, enabling continuous growth through the systematic integration of new understanding. It requires both the courage to examine oneself honestly and the discernment to extract meaningful lessons from both successes and failures.

[Manifestations]
- Thoughtful examination of past decisions and their outcomes
- Recognition of patterns in one's responses and behaviors
- Integration of new insights into future decision-making
- Balanced self-assessment without excessive criticism or praise
- Growing capacity to anticipate consequences of choices
- Development of nuanced understanding in complex situations
- Increasing alignment between knowledge and action

[Functional Description]
Reflective judgment develops through an iterative process of examination, integration, and application. It begins with the careful observation of outcomes and one's role in creating them, progresses through honest analysis and pattern recognition, and culminates in the extraction of principles that can guide future action. This process becomes increasingly refined and automatic with practice, leading to more spontaneous wisdom in action.

In practical terms, this quality manifests as an enhanced capacity to learn from experience and make better decisions over time. It enables people to avoid repeating mistakes, build on successes, and develop more nuanced responses to complex situations. The result is a growing repository of practical wisdom that combines deep understanding with effective action, leading to more skillful navigation of life's challenges.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the philosophical depth of reflective judgment
2. Makes it accessible through common human experiences
3. Maintains practical applicability
4. Shows clear developmental progression
5. Links individual growth to universal wisdom
6. Provides observable manifestations
7. Remains culturally neutral while being specific

Would you like me to:
1. Further refine any section?
2. Add specific examples?
3. Elaborate on developmental stages?
4. Explore relationships with other virtues?
