Let me follow the process step by step for Civic Responsibility.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Active engagement in collective wellbeing
Key functions: 
- Participation in shared governance
- Contributing to common good
- Social awareness and response
- Collective problem-solving
- Community building

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Group membership
- Collective challenges
- Shared resources management
- Community interdependence
- Mutual support systems

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Awareness of collective needs
- Response to shared challenges
- Contribution to group wellbeing
- Balancing individual/collective interests

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, respond to, and actively participate in the wellbeing of one's larger social body. It manifests as the natural movement from individual awareness to collective action, expressing the inherent interconnectedness of human social existence through practical engagement with shared challenges and opportunities.

[Essential Nature]
This quality emerges from the fundamental reality of human interdependence and expresses itself through the individual's growing awareness of their role within larger social systems. It represents the maturation of social consciousness from passive membership to active participation in collective life. At its core, it embodies the recognition that individual flourishing is inseparable from group wellbeing, manifesting as both the wisdom to perceive collective needs and the practical capability to respond effectively.

[Manifestations]
- Recognition of shared challenges and opportunities within one's social sphere
- Spontaneous movement to contribute when collective needs arise
- Natural attention to the impact of personal actions on the whole
- Active participation in group decision-making and implementation
- Practical support of collective initiatives and shared resources
- Development of skills and capabilities that serve common good
- Balance between personal development and collective contribution

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through expanding awareness of social interconnection combined with practical experience in collective action. It begins with basic recognition of group membership, grows through understanding of shared challenges, and matures into skilled participation in collective life. The development process involves increasingly sophisticated perception of social systems alongside growing capability for effective action.

In practice, this quality enables individuals to move naturally between personal and collective perspectives, responding appropriately to shared challenges while maintaining individual authenticity. It manifests as practical wisdom in social participation, ranging from small group dynamics to larger societal engagement, always grounded in recognition of fundamental human interconnectedness and expressed through tangible contribution to collective wellbeing.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: Uses universal human experiences of group membership and collective action rather than specific political frameworks
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding of individual-collective relationship while making it accessible
3. Practical applicability: Focuses on observable behaviors and developmental patterns
4. Individual-Universal connection: Clear progression from personal awareness to collective engagement
5. Developmental clarity: Shows clear progression from basic recognition to sophisticated participation
6. Observable manifestations: All listed expressions are concrete and verifiable

Would you like me to:
1. Refine any particular aspect?
2. Expand on the developmental sequence?
3. Add more practical examples?
4. Clarify any concepts further?
