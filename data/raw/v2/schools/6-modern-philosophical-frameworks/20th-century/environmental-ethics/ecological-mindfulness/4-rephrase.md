Let me follow the process systematically:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Sustained conscious awareness of ecological relationships and impacts
Key functions: 
- Perceptual (awareness of nature)
- Cognitive (understanding connections)
- Behavioral (conscious action)
- Relational (connection with environment)

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Sensory awareness of natural world
- Recognition of cause-effect relationships
- Sense of connection/belonging
- Impact awareness
- Choice-consequence understanding

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain clear, present-moment awareness of our relationship with and impact on the living world, combined with the ability to respond thoughtfully rather than react habitually to environmental challenges and opportunities.

[Essential Nature]
Ecological mindfulness represents the meeting point of awareness and action in our relationship with the living world. It functions as both a perceptual lens and a guidance system, helping us notice, understand, and consciously participate in the web of life. This quality combines immediate sensory awareness with broader pattern recognition, enabling us to perceive both momentary interactions and longer-term consequences of our choices.

Beyond mere attention, it encompasses an active readiness to adjust our behavior based on environmental feedback, fostering a dynamic balance between human needs and ecological health.

[Manifestations]
- Heightened sensory awareness of natural surroundings and processes
- Recognition of cause-effect relationships in ecological systems
- Conscious consideration before environmental impact decisions
- Spontaneous attention to nature's signals and patterns
- Integration of environmental awareness into daily choices
- Progressive development of ecological response capacity
- Growing sensitivity to ecosystem health indicators

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous cycle of perception, integration, and response. The perceptual aspect maintains ongoing awareness of our environmental context and impact, while the integrative function connects this awareness with our understanding of ecological relationships and consequences. The response aspect enables conscious adjustment of behavior based on this integrated awareness, replacing habitual reactions with thoughtful choices.

In practical terms, ecological mindfulness manifests as an increasingly refined capacity to notice, understand, and appropriately respond to environmental conditions and challenges. It develops through regular practice of conscious attention to nature, reflection on environmental impacts, and intentional adjustment of behavior based on ecological understanding. This quality enables both immediate appropriate response to environmental situations and longer-term alignment of behavior with ecological health.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural validity: Uses universal human experiences of awareness and relationship with environment
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language
3. Practical applicability: Clear connection to daily choices and actions
4. Individual-universal connection: Links personal awareness to broader ecological relationships
5. Developmental clarity: Shows progression from basic awareness to sophisticated response
6. Observable manifestations: All listed expressions can be observed/verified in behavior

The description avoids culture-specific references while maintaining the sophisticated understanding of ecological relationships present in environmental ethics. It connects individual experience to universal patterns and provides clear pathways for practical application.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universal description?
