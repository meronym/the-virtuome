Let me follow the analytical process and then provide the universal reformulation.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Recognition of inherent worth in all living beings
Key functions: 
- Extends moral consideration beyond human sphere
- Guides interaction with other life forms
- Informs environmental decision-making
- Shapes human-nature relationship

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Wonder at life's diversity
- Recognition of shared existence
- Experience of other beings' consciousness
- Intuitive sense of life's sanctity

STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Recognition of life's fundamental value
- Expanded circle of moral consideration
- Practical care for other life forms
- Systemic understanding of life's interconnection

Secondary:
- Anthropocentric bias (obstacle)
- Direct nature experience (supporting condition)
- Empathy/compassion (related qualities)
- Conservation behavior (application)

Here's the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize and honor the inherent worth of all living beings, manifesting as an expanded sphere of care and consideration beyond human concerns. This quality enables direct recognition of life's fundamental value and guides harmonious interaction with the living world.

[Essential Nature]
Life-respect emerges from direct recognition of the phenomenon of life itself - the shared quality of being that animates all living creatures. It manifests as an immediate, intuitive sense of life's inherent value, independent of its utility or relationship to human purposes. This recognition naturally expands our sphere of moral consideration and care beyond purely human concerns.

This quality combines cognitive recognition of life's complexity and interconnection with emotional resonance and practical care. It develops through direct experience with other life forms, deepening understanding of shared existence, and growing awareness of life's diverse manifestations.

[Manifestations]
- Immediate recognition of other beings as subjects rather than objects
- Spontaneous care and consideration for other life forms
- Careful attention to impact on other living beings
- Natural restraint in actions that might harm life
- Integration of other beings' needs in decision-making
- Active protection and support of life's flourishing
- Recognition of and respect for each species' unique way of being

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through direct experiential recognition rather than abstract reasoning. When encountered, other living beings are immediately perceived as centers of experience and value rather than mere resources or background elements. This recognition triggers both cognitive appreciation of life's complexity and emotional resonance with other beings' existence, naturally expanding our sphere of practical care and consideration.

In practice, life-respect shapes behavior through both restraint and active care. It manifests as careful consideration before actions that might impact other beings, positive efforts to support life's flourishing, and practical integration of other beings' needs in human activities. This quality develops through direct experience with nature, growing understanding of life's interconnection, and practiced attention to other beings' ways of existing.

This reformulation aims to:
- Express the core phenomenon in universal experiential terms
- Connect abstract recognition to practical manifestation
- Bridge individual experience with universal patterns
- Maintain philosophical depth while ensuring accessibility
- Preserve practical applicability
- Enable cross-cultural understanding

The description focuses on the direct recognition of life's value rather than theoretical frameworks, making it more universally accessible while maintaining the depth and practical implications of the original concept.

Would you like me to revise any aspect of this reformulation or proceed with another virtue from the list?
