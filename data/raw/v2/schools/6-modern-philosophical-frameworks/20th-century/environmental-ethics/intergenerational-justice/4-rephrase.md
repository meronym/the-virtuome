Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Temporal extension of moral consideration and responsibility
Key functions:
- Future impact awareness
- Long-term decision making
- Resource preservation
- Legacy consciousness
- Generational responsibility

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Parent-child care
- Heritage preservation
- Resource management
- Legacy creation
- Future planning
- Ancestral gratitude
- Cultivation/planting
- Teaching/mentoring

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary patterns:
- Temporal awareness
- Care extension
- Resource stewardship
- Legacy building
- Future visioning

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The conscious extension of care and responsibility across time, expressing itself through decisions and actions that honor both ancestral legacy and future possibilities. It manifests as the active preservation of life-sustaining conditions and opportunities for those who will follow us.

[Essential Nature]
Time-extended care represents a fundamental pattern in human consciousness and behavior, visible in everything from parenting to agriculture to education. It emerges from our capacity to learn from the past and imagine the future, combined with our ability to intentionally shape conditions we won't personally experience. This quality transforms immediate self-interest into extended care through the recognition of our role as both inheritors and ancestors.

This temporal extension of moral consideration operates through three primary channels: preservation of life-supporting conditions, transmission of accumulated wisdom, and cultivation of future possibilities. It requires holding multiple time horizons simultaneously while making present decisions.

[Manifestations]
- Careful stewardship of natural resources and ecosystems
- Creation and maintenance of lasting infrastructure and institutions
- Preservation and transmission of knowledge and wisdom
- Development of sustainable practices and systems
- Investment in education and development of future generations
- Protection of biodiversity and environmental conditions
- Creation of enduring cultural and physical legacy

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive expansion of temporal awareness and care, moving from immediate to extended time horizons. It begins with recognition of received benefits from past generations, grows through understanding of present impacts on future conditions, and matures into active commitment to future wellbeing. This development requires cultivation of long-term thinking, systems understanding, and capacity to act on behalf of future interests.

In practice, it manifests as careful consideration of long-term consequences in present decisions, active preservation of vital resources and conditions, and intentional creation of positive future possibilities. It guides both individual choices in daily life and collective decisions about shared resources and systems, fostering responsibility for the ongoing story of human and ecological wellbeing.
