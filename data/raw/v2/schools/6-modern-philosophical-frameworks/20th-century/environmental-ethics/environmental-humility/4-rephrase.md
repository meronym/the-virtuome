Let me follow the process systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
- Core principle: Recognition of human limitations in understanding/controlling nature
- Key functions: Enables learning, prevents hubris, fosters respect
- Systemic role: Foundation for sustainable relationship with nature
- Development: From intellectual recognition to embodied wisdom

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
- Universal experiences: Learning from mistakes, discovering complexity, feeling awe
- Parallel concepts: Scientific humility, wisdom traditions' modesty, indigenous respect
- Contemporary relevance: Technology limits, ecosystem complexity, climate change
- Timeless patterns: Human-nature interdependence, limits of control

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize and accept the inherent limitations of human understanding and control over natural systems, combined with an openness to learning from nature's wisdom and complexity. This quality enables sustainable relationship with natural systems through conscious recognition of interdependence and careful restraint in intervention.

[Essential Nature]
Environmental humility emerges from direct encounter with nature's complexity and power, manifesting as both intellectual recognition and emotional acceptance of human limitations. It operates as a counterbalance to technological hubris and anthropocentric assumptions, fostering deep appreciation for natural wisdom accumulated over evolutionary time. This quality combines clear-eyed assessment of human capabilities with genuine reverence for nature's intricate systems, creating space for learning from rather than attempting to dominate natural processes.

[Manifestations]
- Careful observation before action in natural systems
- Willingness to learn from natural processes and patterns
- Restraint in technological intervention without understanding
- Recognition and acknowledgment of mistakes in environmental management
- Openness to indigenous and traditional ecological knowledge
- Deep appreciation for ecosystem complexity and interconnection
- Active consideration of unknown consequences in decision-making

[Functional Description]
Environmental humility develops through direct experience with nature's complexity and power, often catalyzed by encounters with environmental challenges or failures of human-centered approaches. It begins with intellectual recognition of limitations but deepens into embodied wisdom through ongoing engagement with natural systems. This quality grows through cycles of observation, attempted understanding, recognition of limits, and refined approach.

In practice, this quality enables more sustainable human-nature relationships by moderating intervention impulses and fostering careful, observant engagement with natural systems. It supports better environmental decision-making by maintaining awareness of knowledge gaps, encouraging multiple perspectives, and promoting adaptive management approaches. This creates space for nature's wisdom to guide human action while preventing harmful overconfidence in technological solutions.

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? Yes - based on universal human experience with nature
2. Preserves depth? Yes - captures both practical and philosophical dimensions
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear implications for decision-making and action
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal development to ecological understanding
5. Development clear? Yes - shows progression from intellectual to embodied wisdom
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - concrete behavioral indicators provided

The description maintains the sophistication of environmental ethics while making it accessible through universal human experiences and practical manifestations. It preserves the core meaning while enabling broader application across cultural contexts.
