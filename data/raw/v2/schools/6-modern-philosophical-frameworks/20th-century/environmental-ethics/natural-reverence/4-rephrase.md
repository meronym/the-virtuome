[Core Definition]
Natural reverence is the innate human capacity to recognize and deeply respond to the profound value, beauty, and mystery inherent in the natural world. It manifests as a combination of wonder, respect, and care that emerges from direct experience of nature's complexity and majesty.

[Essential Nature]
Natural reverence arises from the direct recognition of nature's inherent value and mystery, transcending mere utility or resource-based perspectives. It represents a fundamental shift in consciousness where nature is experienced not as separate or subordinate to human concerns, but as a vast, complex web of life worthy of deep respect and protection. This quality combines emotional resonance, intuitive understanding, and ethical response, creating a foundation for sustainable human-nature relationships.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous feelings of awe and wonder in natural settings
- Deep sense of connection with and belonging to the natural world
- Protective instinct toward living things and natural systems
- Recognition of sacred or profound meaning in natural phenomena
- Careful, respectful interaction with natural environments
- Emotional response to natural beauty and complexity
- Active engagement in nature protection and restoration

[Functional Description]
Natural reverence develops through direct experience with nature, beginning with moments of wonder or awe that evolve into deeper understanding and ethical commitment. It operates by awakening innate human capacity for recognition of value beyond utility, engaging both emotional and cognitive faculties to create a profound sense of nature's worth. This quality grows through repeated exposure to nature's beauty and complexity, supported by reflection and conscious cultivation of attention.

In practice, natural reverence transforms human behavior by providing internal motivation for environmental protection and sustainable living. It manifests in careful consideration of environmental impact, active protection of natural systems, and cultivation of deep nature connection in others. This quality serves as a foundation for environmental ethics by bridging emotional experience with ethical action, creating lasting commitment to ecological well-being.
