Let me follow the analytical process for Ecological Resilience:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Adaptive capacity within ecological relationships
Key functions:
- Recovery from disturbance
- Flexible response to change
- System maintenance under stress
- Dynamic equilibrium maintenance
Systemic role: Enables sustainable relationship with environment

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Adapting to changing circumstances
- Recovering from setbacks
- Maintaining balance under pressure
- Learning from environmental feedback
Contemporary relevance: Essential for climate change, environmental degradation, sustainable living

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary:
- Capacity for environmental adaptation
- Balance of stability and change
- Integration of feedback
- System-level awareness
Secondary:
- Resistance to ecological denial
- Need for environmental knowledge
- Connection to natural rhythms
- Practice in multiple contexts

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain beneficial relationships with natural systems while adapting to environmental change, combining flexibility with persistence, awareness with action, and individual behavior with systemic understanding. This quality enables sustainable interaction with the natural world through conscious adaptation and responsive resilience.

[Essential Nature]
Ecological resilience represents the human capacity to develop dynamic, sustainable relationships with natural systems. It combines practical adaptability with deep understanding of natural processes, enabling both personal and collective responses to environmental change. This quality manifests as a balanced approach to environmental challenges, neither rigid resistance nor passive acceptance, but rather intelligent adaptation that maintains essential functions while evolving with changing conditions.

[Manifestations]
- Flexible response to environmental feedback without losing core stability
- Practical adaptation of behavior based on ecological understanding
- Balance between immediate needs and system sustainability
- Integration of traditional wisdom with new environmental knowledge
- Active participation in ecosystem restoration and maintenance
- Development of sustainable practices that can evolve with changing conditions
- Creation of resilient communities through environmental cooperation

[Functional Description]
Ecological resilience operates through continuous awareness of environmental relationships combined with practical adaptation skills. It develops through direct experience with natural systems, understanding of ecological principles, and practice in responding to environmental change. This quality grows stronger through cycles of challenge and adaptation, building both personal capacity and systemic understanding.

In practice, ecological resilience manifests as the ability to maintain beneficial environmental relationships while navigating change. It enables individuals and communities to respond effectively to environmental challenges, develop sustainable practices, and contribute to ecosystem health. This quality supports both immediate adaptation and long-term environmental stewardship, fostering resilient relationships between human and natural systems.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? Yes - focuses on universal human-nature relationship experience
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophistication while increasing accessibility
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear manifestations and development path
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal capacity to systemic impact
5. Development clarity? Yes - shows how quality grows through experience and practice
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - concrete behaviors and outcomes listed

The description successfully transforms the environmental ethics concept into universal language while maintaining its essential meaning and practical value. It connects individual experience to universal principles and provides clear development paths and manifestations.
