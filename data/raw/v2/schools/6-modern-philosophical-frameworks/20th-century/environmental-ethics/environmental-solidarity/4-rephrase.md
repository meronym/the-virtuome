Let me follow the process systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Collective environmental responsibility and action
Functions: 
- Unites individuals for environmental protection
- Builds community around ecological goals
- Facilitates collective environmental action
- Bridges local and global concerns

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Group cooperation for common good
- Shared responsibility
- Collective problem-solving
- Community resilience

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Active cooperation for ecological wellbeing
- Shared environmental responsibility
- Cross-boundary collaboration
- Collective environmental agency

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, feel, and act upon our shared responsibility for ecological wellbeing, manifesting as collective action and mutual support in addressing environmental challenges. This quality enables the transformation of individual environmental concern into coordinated, effective community response.

[Essential Nature]
Environmental solidarity represents the human capacity to extend care and responsibility beyond individual environmental action to collective stewardship. It emerges from the recognition that ecological challenges require coordinated response and manifests as active participation in shared environmental initiatives. This quality bridges the gap between personal environmental awareness and collective environmental action, transforming isolated concern into coordinated response.

More than mere cooperation, it embodies the deep recognition of our interdependence with both ecological systems and human communities, fostering resilient networks of mutual support and shared purpose in environmental protection.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous organization around environmental challenges
- Active participation in community environmental initiatives
- Mutual support in sustainable practices
- Cross-boundary collaboration for ecological protection
- Shared responsibility in environmental stewardship
- Integration of diverse perspectives in environmental action
- Collective resilience in facing ecological challenges

[Functional Description]
Environmental solidarity develops through progressive expansion of environmental concern from personal to collective domains. It begins with recognition of shared environmental stakes and grows through collaborative action. The quality strengthens through successful collective experiences, building trust and capability for larger-scale environmental initiatives. As it matures, it creates self-reinforcing networks of mutual support and shared environmental responsibility.

In practice, this quality enables communities to respond effectively to environmental challenges that exceed individual capacity. It manifests as spontaneous collaboration during environmental crises, sustained cooperation in conservation efforts, and the development of shared environmental practices. The quality creates resilient networks of environmental action that can persist and adapt despite changing circumstances or challenges.
