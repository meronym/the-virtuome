Let me follow the structured approach to universalize the concept of Public Utility.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
- Core principle: Orientation toward collective benefit/wellbeing
- Key functions: Social benefit evaluation, collective impact consideration
- Systemic role: Bridges individual action and collective outcomes
- Developmental: Progresses from local to systemic understanding

UNIVERSALIZATION:
- Universal experiences: Group cooperation, shared resources, collective challenges
- Parallel concepts: Social responsibility, collective wisdom, community care
- Contemporary relevance: Sustainability, social impact, shared prosperity
- Timeless patterns: Balance of individual/collective, short-term/long-term

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to understand, value, and actively contribute to collective wellbeing through recognizing the interconnected nature of human flourishing and making choices that enhance shared prosperity. This quality enables individuals to bridge personal action with communal benefit, fostering sustainable social progress.

[Essential Nature]
Public utility represents the developed awareness that human wellbeing is fundamentally interconnected, manifesting as the ability to recognize and act upon opportunities for collective benefit. It transcends simple altruism by incorporating sophisticated understanding of social systems, long-term consequences, and the dynamic relationship between individual and collective prosperity. This quality combines practical wisdom about social dynamics with the motivation to enhance shared wellbeing through considered action.

[Manifestations]
- Recognition of opportunities to create collective benefit in daily choices
- Skilled evaluation of actions' broader social impacts and ripple effects
- Natural consideration of multiple stakeholders in decision-making
- Integration of personal and collective interests in practical solutions
- Active contribution to shared resources and common goods
- Development of systems that enhance collective capability
- Creation of sustainable value for communities and networks

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through enhanced awareness of social interconnection combined with practical capability for impact assessment. It develops through progressively wider circles of consideration - from immediate family to local community to broader society - accompanied by growing understanding of social systems and long-term effects. The capacity builds through direct experience with collective challenges and successful cooperation, supported by reflection on outcomes and refinement of approach.

In practice, it manifests as a natural tendency to consider collective impact in daily decisions, skilled navigation of competing interests, and creative problem-solving that benefits multiple stakeholders. This creates a virtuous cycle where individual actions enhance collective capability, which in turn provides greater resources and opportunities for all participants. The result is sustainable social progress built on practical wisdom about human interdependence.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: √ (focuses on universal experience of collective living)
2. Preserves depth: √ (maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible)
3. Practical applicability: √ (clear manifestations and development path)
4. Individual-universal connection: √ (explicitly bridges personal and collective)
5. Development clarity: √ (shows progression from basic to advanced understanding)
6. Observable manifestations: √ (concrete, verifiable expressions)

The universalized concept maintains the sophisticated understanding of social dynamics from empiricist ethics while making it accessible through connection to universal human experiences of collective living and shared prosperity. It preserves the practical orientation while expanding applicability beyond specific cultural contexts.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
