Let me follow the process step by step:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Regulated response to internal/external stimuli
Key functions: 
- Emotional regulation
- Impulse management
- Rational oversight
- Balanced judgment
- Intentional action

Relationship patterns:
- Mediates between impulse and action
- Balances individual/social needs
- Integrates emotion and reason
- Connects insight to behavior

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Managing emotional reactions
- Delaying gratification
- Choosing responses
- Maintaining composure
- Developing self-awareness

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Self-awareness foundation
- Response regulation
- Intentional choice
- Progressive development

Secondary Elements:
- Integration of emotion/reason
- Balance of opposing forces
- Cultivation of wisdom
- Social harmonization

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain conscious oversight of one's internal state and external responses, enabling chosen rather than reactive behavior. This fundamental human ability integrates awareness, understanding, and intentional action, allowing for balanced engagement with life's challenges and opportunities.

[Essential Nature]
Self-command emerges from the interplay between awareness and response, operating as an internal guidance system that transforms raw impulses into considered actions. It represents neither rigid control nor passive acceptance, but rather a dynamic balance that allows for appropriate response to changing circumstances while maintaining internal coherence and alignment with deeper values.

This quality develops through the progressive integration of understanding and practice, as immediate reactions are transformed into chosen responses through the cultivation of awareness, the exercise of judgment, and the development of responsive rather than reactive patterns of behavior.

[Manifestations]
- Maintained composure in challenging circumstances
- Thoughtful response rather than immediate reaction
- Balanced expression of emotion appropriate to context
- Integration of multiple perspectives in decision-making
- Alignment of behavior with values and intentions
- Progressive development of response flexibility

[Functional Description]
Self-command operates through a continuous cycle of awareness, evaluation, and chosen response. It begins with recognition of internal states and external triggers, proceeds through assessment of appropriate action, and culminates in intentional response. This process becomes increasingly refined and automatic through practice, while maintaining conscious oversight of previously automatic reactions.

In practical expression, self-command enables maintaining effectiveness under pressure, adapting responses to changing circumstances, and aligning actions with intentions. It manifests as neither rigid control nor unrestrained expression, but as a dynamic balance that allows for authentic yet appropriate engagement with life's challenges, relationships, and opportunities for growth.

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural? Yes - focuses on universal human experience of managing responses
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophistication while using accessible language
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear connection to daily experience and challenges
4. Individual/Universal? Yes - connects personal development to universal patterns
5. Development clear? Yes - describes progressive refinement through practice
6. Observable? Yes - manifestations are concrete and verifiable

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
