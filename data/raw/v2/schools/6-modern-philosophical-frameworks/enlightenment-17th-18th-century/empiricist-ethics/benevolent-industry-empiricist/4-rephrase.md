Let me follow the analytical process and then provide the universalized description.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Productive activity aligned with collective benefit
Key functions: 
- Creating value while serving social good
- Harmonizing individual and collective interests
- Converting effort into shared prosperity
- Building sustainable social value

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Creating/producing
- Contributing to community
- Finding purpose in work
- Balancing self-interest and social good
- Building sustainable value

Contemporary parallels:
- Social entrepreneurship
- Sustainable business
- Purpose-driven work
- Collaborative economics
- Stakeholder capitalism

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to engage in productive activity that simultaneously serves individual fulfillment and collective wellbeing, characterized by the skillful integration of personal industry with social benefit. This quality manifests as the ability to create value while contributing positively to the larger community.

[Essential Nature]
Benevolent industry represents the harmonious fusion of productive capability with social consciousness. It transcends the false dichotomy between self-interest and collective good, recognizing that truly sustainable value creation must serve both individual and community needs. This quality enables its possessor to transform personal effort into multi-level benefit, creating ripple effects of positive impact through practical activity.

At its core, it embodies the universal human capacity to contribute meaningfully to the world while growing personally, reflecting the deep interconnection between individual flourishing and social progress.

[Manifestations]
- Creating solutions that address both personal and community needs
- Building sustainable systems that generate shared value
- Developing skills and capabilities that benefit self and others
- Converting personal talents into social contributions
- Finding innovative ways to align individual and collective interests
- Maintaining long-term perspective in productive activities

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through the conscious development of productive capabilities guided by awareness of social impact. It begins with personal skill cultivation and extends through increasingly sophisticated understanding of social systems and collective needs. The development process involves progressively larger circles of consideration, from immediate effects to long-term systemic impacts.

In practical expression, benevolent industry manifests as the capacity to identify and pursue opportunities that create multilayer value. It enables individuals to navigate complex social-economic systems while maintaining alignment between personal growth and collective benefit. This quality supports the development of sustainable solutions to shared challenges while ensuring the continued development of individual capabilities and resources.
```

This universalization:
- Preserves the empiricist focus on practical outcomes
- Maintains the balance of individual/collective benefit
- Translates 18th-century commercial context to contemporary relevance
- Retains sophistication while using accessible language
- Emphasizes observable manifestations and development
- Links individual capacity to universal human experience

The description should be meaningful across cultures while maintaining the philosophical depth of the original empiricist concept. It connects personal development with social impact in ways that remain practically applicable across various contexts.

Would you like me to revise any aspect to better meet the universalization objectives?
