[Core Definition]
The innate human capacity to feel, understand, and respond to moral situations through direct emotional experience and social resonance, enabling spontaneous ethical awareness and authentic moral response without requiring abstract reasoning or formal rules.

[Essential Nature]
Moral sentiment represents the fundamental human ability to directly perceive and feel ethical dimensions of life through emotional and social intelligence. Like our capacity to sense physical reality through our bodies, moral sentiment allows us to sense the ethical texture of situations through our emotional and social awareness. This faculty combines immediate intuitive understanding with deeper patterns of care, operating as a natural bridge between individual feeling and universal moral truth.

This quality manifests as a spectrum of capabilities, from basic empathy to sophisticated moral intuition, enabling both immediate ethical responses and the development of nuanced moral understanding through accumulated emotional-social experience. It serves as the foundation for genuine moral behavior, authentic social bonds, and the natural development of ethical wisdom.

[Functional Description]
Moral sentiment operates as an immediate mode of ethical perception and understanding, functioning through direct emotional-social awareness rather than abstract reasoning. This faculty processes complex social-moral information instantly, drawing on both innate sensitivity and accumulated experience to generate appropriate ethical responses. Like emotional intelligence applied to moral domains, it enables rapid, intuitive understanding of ethical situations while providing motivation for moral action.

In practical expression, moral sentiment manifests as spontaneous ethical awareness and natural moral response in daily life. It enables authentic care in relationships, intuitive navigation of social situations, and immediate recognition of moral implications. This faculty develops through direct experience and reflection, gradually expanding from basic empathy to sophisticated moral intuition while remaining grounded in genuine feeling rather than abstract rules.
