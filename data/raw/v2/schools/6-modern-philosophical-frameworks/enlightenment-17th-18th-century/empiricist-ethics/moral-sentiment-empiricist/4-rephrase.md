Let me follow the analytical process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Natural human capacity for moral-emotional responsiveness
Key functions:
- Social bonding and cohesion
- Ethical intuition and judgment
- Interpersonal understanding
- Moral motivation
- Emotional intelligence

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Feeling others' joy/pain
- Natural care for close ones
- Spontaneous helping impulses
- Social emotional attunement
- Moral intuitions

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Innate capacity for moral feeling
- Social-emotional intelligence
- Ethical sensitivity
- Interpersonal resonance

Secondary Elements:
- Cultural shaping of expression
- Development through experience
- Balance with reason
- Social application

Here's the universalized description following the requested format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The innate human capacity to feel, understand, and respond to moral situations through direct emotional experience and social resonance, enabling spontaneous ethical awareness and authentic moral response without requiring abstract reasoning or formal rules.

[Essential Nature]
Moral sentiment represents the fundamental human ability to directly perceive and feel ethical dimensions of life through emotional and social intelligence. Like our capacity to sense physical reality through our bodies, moral sentiment allows us to sense the ethical texture of situations through our emotional and social awareness. This faculty combines immediate intuitive understanding with deeper patterns of care, operating as a natural bridge between individual feeling and universal moral truth.

This quality manifests as a spectrum of capabilities, from basic empathy to sophisticated moral intuition, enabling both immediate ethical responses and the development of nuanced moral understanding through accumulated emotional-social experience. It serves as the foundation for genuine moral behavior, authentic social bonds, and the natural development of ethical wisdom.

[Manifestations]
Immediate Expressions:
- Spontaneous empathy with others' experiences
- Natural care response to perceived need
- Intuitive sense of fairness and reciprocity
- Immediate recognition of moral situations
- Authentic emotional response to ethical events
- Direct awareness of social-emotional dynamics

Developmental Aspects:
- Deepens through varied social experience
- Refines through reflection and application
- Expands from personal to universal concern
- Integrates with rational understanding
- Matures into stable moral character

[Functional Description]
Moral sentiment operates as an immediate mode of ethical perception and understanding, functioning through direct emotional-social awareness rather than abstract reasoning. This faculty processes complex social-moral information instantly, drawing on both innate sensitivity and accumulated experience to generate appropriate ethical responses. Like emotional intelligence applied to moral domains, it enables rapid, intuitive understanding of ethical situations while providing motivation for moral action.

In practical expression, moral sentiment manifests as spontaneous ethical awareness and natural moral response in daily life. It enables authentic care in relationships, intuitive navigation of social situations, and immediate recognition of moral implications. This faculty develops through direct experience and reflection, gradually expanding from basic empathy to sophisticated moral intuition while remaining grounded in genuine feeling rather than abstract rules.
```

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the empiricist insight about moral sentiment's fundamental nature
2. Translates it into phenomenological language
3. Connects it to universal human experience
4. Maintains practical applicability
5. Shows developmental aspects
6. Links individual experience to universal patterns

The description should be meaningful across cultures while maintaining the sophisticated understanding developed in empiricist ethics. It emphasizes observable manifestations and practical development while preserving the deeper philosophical insights about the nature of moral understanding.

Would you like me to revise any aspect to better meet the universalization objectives?
