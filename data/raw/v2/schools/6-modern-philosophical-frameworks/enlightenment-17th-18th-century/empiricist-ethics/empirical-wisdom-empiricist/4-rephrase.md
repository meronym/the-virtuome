Let me follow the process systematically for Empirical Wisdom.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Learning from direct experience and observation
Key functions: 
- Pattern recognition
- Knowledge integration
- Reality testing
- Practical application
- Experiential verification

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Learning from mistakes
- Pattern recognition in daily life
- Testing assumptions against reality
- Growing through experience
- Practical problem-solving

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to learn deeply from direct experience, combining careful observation with practical understanding to build reliable knowledge about reality. It manifests as the ability to recognize patterns, test assumptions, and apply lessons learned across contexts while maintaining openness to new evidence and perspectives.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the mind's natural ability to learn from experience in a systematic and meaningful way. Unlike theoretical knowledge, it emerges from direct engagement with reality through observation, testing, and practical application. It combines the clarity of careful attention with the depth of accumulated understanding, enabling increasingly refined judgment about what is true and effective.

This wisdom develops through an ongoing dialogue between experience and understanding, where each new situation both applies and refines previous learning. It requires both openness to new information and the discipline to verify assumptions against reality, creating a growing foundation of reliable knowledge grounded in direct experience.

[Manifestations]
- Recognition of recurring patterns in events and relationships
- Ability to learn meaningful lessons from both success and failure
- Systematic testing of ideas against practical reality
- Growing refinement in judgment and decision-making
- Integration of new experiences with existing understanding
- Increasing accuracy in predicting practical outcomes
- Natural skepticism toward untested assumptions

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous cycle of observation, pattern recognition, testing, and integration. Each experience becomes an opportunity for learning, with attention focused on understanding what actually works rather than what should work in theory. The mind naturally begins to recognize deeper patterns and principles, building a practical understanding that becomes increasingly reliable over time.

In daily life, this wisdom manifests as improved judgment, more accurate predictions, and better practical decisions. It leads to greater effectiveness in handling challenges, stronger ability to learn from mistakes, and increasing clarity about what approaches are likely to succeed in different situations. This creates a natural progression toward more refined understanding and more reliable action across all areas of life.

- Preserves empiricist emphasis on direct experience
- Retains systematic aspect of knowledge building

3. Practical applicability: ✓
- Clear connection to daily decision-making
- Observable manifestations
- Concrete development pathway

4. Individual-Universal connection: ✓
- Links personal experience to universal patterns
- Shows how individual learning builds broader understanding
- Connects specific instances to general principles

5. Development clarity: ✓
- Clear progression path
- Natural learning cycle described
- Cumulative nature of development shown

6. Observable manifestations: ✓
- Concrete behavioral indicators
- Verifiable expressions
- Practical outcomes specified

The description maintains the sophistication of empiricist epistemology while making it accessible through universal human experiences of learning and pattern recognition. It preserves the emphasis on direct experience while showing practical relevance to contemporary life.
