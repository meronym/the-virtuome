Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS (Prudence):
Core principle: Wisdom applied to practical decision-making
Key functions: 
- Evaluating consequences
- Balancing competing interests
- Resource allocation
- Risk assessment
- Strategic planning
Systemic role: Bridge between knowledge and action
Developmental aspects: Progresses from simple caution to sophisticated judgment

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Decision-making under uncertainty
- Managing limited resources
- Weighing short vs long-term benefits
- Navigating complex choices
- Learning from experience

STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary elements:
- Practical wisdom in action
- Forward-thinking evaluation
- Experience-based judgment
- Resource stewardship
Secondary elements:
- Balance between caution and action
- Integration of past learning
- Consideration of consequences
- Stakeholder awareness

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to make sound judgments and decisions through careful consideration of present circumstances, future consequences, and available resources. It combines experiential wisdom with practical action, enabling effective navigation of life's complexities while maintaining long-term well-being for self and others.

[Essential Nature]
Prudence operates as the bridge between knowledge and action, transforming understanding into effective decision-making. It represents the mature development of judgment that integrates past experience, present awareness, and future consideration. Unlike mere caution or conservation, prudence is an active capacity that seeks optimal outcomes through careful evaluation of possibilities and circumstances. It manifests as a dynamic balance between thoughtful restraint and decisive action, informed by both practical experience and rational analysis.

[Manifestations]
- Careful evaluation of options before significant decisions
- Effective resource allocation across competing needs
- Strategic planning that accounts for multiple scenarios
- Balanced consideration of short-term and long-term impacts
- Integration of past experiences into current decision-making
- Skillful risk assessment and management
- Consideration of wider implications beyond immediate effects

[Functional Description]
Prudence develops through an iterative process of experience, reflection, and application. It begins with basic caution and grows through conscious attention to outcomes and their causes. As it matures, it becomes increasingly sophisticated, incorporating multiple perspectives, longer time horizons, and broader consideration of consequences. This development creates a flexible wisdom that can adapt to new situations while maintaining core principles of sound judgment.

In practice, prudence manifests as the ability to navigate complex situations effectively while maintaining long-term well-being. It enables individuals to make decisions that balance multiple factors, manage resources sustainably, and achieve objectives while minimizing unintended negative consequences. This capacity becomes particularly valuable in situations of uncertainty, limited resources, or competing priorities, where it facilitates optimal outcomes through careful consideration and strategic action.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the core wisdom of Franklin's concept
2. Makes it accessible across cultures
3. Maintains practical applicability
4. Connects individual to universal aspects
5. Charts clear developmental progression
6. Provides observable manifestations
7. Retains sophistication while improving accessibility
8. Emphasizes experiential understanding over theoretical knowledge

The description avoids culture-specific references while maintaining the sophisticated understanding of prudence as both a decision-making capacity and a developmental achievement. It connects individual practice to universal principles and provides clear pathways for practical application.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet the objectives?
