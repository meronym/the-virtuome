```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity and commitment to actively participate in and contribute to the wellbeing of one's broader social group, combining awareness of collective needs with practical action to address them. This quality enables individuals to transcend pure self-interest while maintaining personal agency in service of shared flourishing.

[Essential Nature]
Civic virtue represents the development of human social consciousness beyond immediate personal or family bonds into wider circles of care and responsibility. It manifests as an active recognition that individual wellbeing is inextricably linked to collective wellbeing, coupled with the practical wisdom and motivation to act on this understanding. This quality combines awareness, capability, and commitment in service of shared growth and development.

This virtue operates at the intersection of individual agency and collective needs, embodying the human capacity to consciously participate in and contribute to social systems larger than oneself. It represents a mature expression of social consciousness that maintains individual autonomy while recognizing and acting upon shared responsibilities and opportunities.

[Manifestations]
- Proactive identification and addressing of community needs
- Responsible participation in collective decision-making
- Voluntary contribution of time and resources to shared causes
- Leadership initiatives that serve collective interests
- Balanced consideration of individual and group needs in choices
- Development and maintenance of community resources
- Active engagement in collective problem-solving

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through expanding awareness of social interconnection combined with growing capacity for effective action. It begins with basic recognition of belonging to larger social groups, evolves through understanding of collective needs and dynamics, and matures into skilled participation in and contribution to community life. The development process involves both increasing awareness of social systems and growing practical ability to contribute effectively to them.

In practice, this quality enables individuals to identify opportunities for meaningful contribution, understand complex social dynamics, and take effective action for collective benefit. It manifests in daily choices that consider broader impact, regular participation in community initiatives, and leadership in collective enterprises. The quality combines practical skills with ethical awareness, enabling effective action that serves both individual and collective flourishing.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the core meaning of Franklin's civic virtue
2. Makes it accessible across cultural contexts
3. Maintains practical applicability
4. Links individual to collective aspects
5. Shows clear developmental pathway
6. Provides observable manifestations
7. Retains philosophical sophistication
8. Ensures contemporary relevance

The description avoids culture-specific references while maintaining the depth and practical utility of Franklin's original concept. It emphasizes universal human experiences of group membership and collective action while providing clear guidance for practical application.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization to better meet our objectives?
