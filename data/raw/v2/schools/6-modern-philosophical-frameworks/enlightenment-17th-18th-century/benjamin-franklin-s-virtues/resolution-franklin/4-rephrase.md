Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Resolution:
Core principle: The capacity to maintain chosen direction despite resistance
Key functions: Decision activation, persistence enablement, commitment fulfillment
Systemic role: Bridge between intention and action
Developmental aspect: Strengthens through progressive challenge-meeting

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Overcoming internal resistance
- Maintaining course despite obstacles
- Converting decisions into actions
- Building momentum through consistency
- Recovering from setbacks

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The inherent capacity to transform decisions into sustained action through unwavering commitment and persistent effort, maintaining chosen direction despite internal resistance or external obstacles. This quality enables the bridge between intention and accomplishment through consistent application of will and focused energy.

[Essential Nature]
Resolution manifests as an internal firmness that holds steady in the face of resistance, whether from internal doubts, external challenges, or environmental pressures. It operates as both a stabilizing and activating force â€“ stabilizing in its maintenance of chosen direction, and activating in its conversion of potential into kinetic energy. Unlike mere stubbornness, resolution contains within it intelligent adaptation while maintaining core commitment.

This quality represents the human capacity to extend present intention into future action through sustained application of will. It encompasses both the initial thrust of decisive action and the sustained force of persistent effort, combining immediate clarity with long-term endurance.

[Manifestations]
- Steady progress toward chosen objectives despite fluctuating conditions
- Consistent return to chosen path following disruptions
- Maintained focus and effort through periods of doubt or difficulty
- Regular renewal of commitment through conscious recommitment
- Calibrated effort adjustment without core intention compromise
- Progressive strengthening through successfully navigated challenges
- Integration of experience into enhanced commitment capacity

[Functional Description]
Resolution operates through a dynamic interplay of commitment renewal and adaptive persistence. When activated, it creates a self-reinforcing cycle where each successfully maintained commitment strengthens the capacity for future commitment-keeping. This quality establishes an internal reference point that remains stable despite emotional fluctuations or circumstantial changes, allowing for consistent action aligned with chosen direction.

In practical application, resolution manifests as the ability to maintain productive action through obstacles, setbacks, and periods of low motivation. It enables the crucial transition from initial enthusiasm to sustained effort, providing the continuous force necessary for significant achievement. This quality develops through progressive challenge-engagement, where each successfully navigated difficulty enhances future capacity for sustained commitment.

This universal description:
1. Preserves the core strength of Franklin's concept while making it accessible across cultures
2. Maintains focus on observable manifestations and practical development
3. Connects individual experience to universal human capacity
4. Provides clear developmental pathway
5. Addresses both internal and external dimensions
6. Maintains sophistication while using experiential language
7. Shows clear practical relevance and application

The description meets the quality criteria by:
- Comprehensiveness: Addresses multiple dimensions and aspects
- Accessibility: Uses universal human experiences as reference points
- Precision: Clearly distinguishes from related qualities (e.g., stubbornness)
- Relevance: Shows clear contemporary applications and value

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universal description?
