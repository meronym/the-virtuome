Let me follow the structured approach to universalize the Kantian concept of Achtung.

ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Recognition-response to inherent worth/dignity
Key functions: 
- Moral recognition
- Value acknowledgment
- Boundary maintenance
- Dignity affirmation
Universal experiences:
- Encountering greatness/dignity
- Recognizing inherent worth
- Feeling appropriate distance/reverence
- Experiencing moral elevation

UNIVERSALIZATION:
```markdown
[Core Definition]
The innate human capacity to recognize and appropriately respond to inherent worth, dignity, and moral truth. It manifests as a profound yet grounding awareness that naturally elicits both reverence and responsible action, while maintaining appropriate boundaries and acknowledgment of fundamental worth in self and others.

[Essential Nature]
Recognition-respect represents a unique fusion of perception and response - it is both a way of seeing and a way of being moved by what we see. Unlike mere emotional reaction or intellectual acknowledgment, it engages our whole being in recognizing genuine worth and responding appropriately. This quality operates as an inner compass that attunes us to the inherent dignity present in rational beings and moral truths.

It serves as a bridge between understanding and action, between self and other, between the personal and universal. While it includes elements of feeling, it is not merely emotional - it represents a fundamental way of perceiving and honoring reality that shapes both attitude and behavior.

[Manifestations]
- Natural maintenance of appropriate boundaries and distance in relationships
- Spontaneous recognition and acknowledgment of others' dignity and worth
- Measured, considered responses that honor both self and other
- Capacity to be deeply moved by moral truth and human dignity
- Balance of warmth and appropriate formality in interactions
- Protected space for others' autonomy and self-determination
- Visible care in handling matters of importance or significance

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of our capacity to recognize and respond to worth and dignity. It begins with simple recognition of authority or achievement but matures into a nuanced awareness of inherent worth in all rational beings. The development involves both increasing sensitivity to dignity and growing capability for appropriate response - neither too familiar nor too distant, neither overly emotional nor coldly intellectual.

In practical terms, recognition-respect shapes how we approach both people and principles. It manifests in the tone and manner of interactions, in the care taken with responsibilities, and in the maintenance of appropriate boundaries. It enables both proper distance and genuine connection, allowing relationships that honor both the universal worth and particular nature of each person. This quality is essential for professional conduct, ethical leadership, and authentic human relationships.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: The concept of recognizing and honoring worth/dignity is universal
2. Depth preservation: Maintains philosophical sophistication while making it experientially accessible
3. Practical applicability: Clear behavioral and relational implications
4. Individual-Universal connection: Links personal recognition to universal worth
5. Developmental clarity: Shows progression from basic to mature manifestations
6. Observable manifestations: Concrete behavioral and relational indicators provided

The universalization maintains the essential insights of Kantian Achtung while making them accessible through common human experience and observable manifestations. It preserves the philosophical sophistication while grounding it in practical reality.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
