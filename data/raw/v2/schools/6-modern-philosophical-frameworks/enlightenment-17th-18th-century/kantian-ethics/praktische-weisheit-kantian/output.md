[Core Definition]
The mature capacity to recognize, understand, and navigate moral complexity in practical situations, integrating deep understanding with experiential wisdom to make sound judgments that honor both universal principles and specific circumstances.

[Essential Nature]
Practical wisdom represents the developed ability to bridge the gap between abstract understanding and concrete action. It manifests as a refined form of judgment that goes beyond both pure theoretical knowledge and mere practical experience. This quality enables one to perceive the essential moral dimensions of situations, recognize relevant factors, and determine appropriate responses that honor both universal principles and particular circumstances.

This capacity emerges through the integration of knowledge, experience, and reflection, developing into an intuitive understanding that guides action while remaining grounded in rational principles. It combines clarity of perception, depth of understanding, and skillful implementation.

[Manifestations]
- Recognizing the core ethical dimensions of complex situations
- Making nuanced judgments that balance competing considerations
- Applying universal principles appropriately to specific contexts
- Learning systematically from experience and reflection
- Guiding others through ethical complexity
- Maintaining principle while adapting to circumstance
- Developing increasingly refined judgment over time

[Functional Description]
Practical wisdom operates as an integrative capacity that brings together multiple forms of understanding: theoretical knowledge, experiential learning, situational awareness, and moral sensitivity. It develops through conscious engagement with challenging situations, reflection on experience, and progressive refinement of judgment. This quality enables one to perceive both the universal patterns and unique elements in each situation, leading to decisions that are both principled and practically effective.

In daily life, this wisdom manifests as the ability to navigate complex situations with clarity and skill. It enables one to make decisions that others recognize as sound, even if they cannot fully articulate why. This capacity helps balance competing demands, identify core issues, and find solutions that honor both practical constraints and ethical principles. It represents the highest development of practical judgment in service of moral aims.
