Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Integration of moral understanding and practical judgment
Functions: Decision-making, situation assessment, principle application
Systemic role: Bridge between theory and practice, wisdom development
Developmental: Builds through experience and reflection

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Making difficult decisions
- Learning from experience
- Applying principles to complex situations
- Developing judgment over time

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary elements:
- Integration of knowledge and action
- Practical judgment capacity
- Experiential learning process
- Ethical discernment

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The mature capacity to recognize, understand, and navigate moral complexity in practical situations, integrating deep understanding with experiential wisdom to make sound judgments that honor both universal principles and specific circumstances.

[Essential Nature]
Practical wisdom represents the developed ability to bridge the gap between abstract understanding and concrete action. It manifests as a refined form of judgment that goes beyond both pure theoretical knowledge and mere practical experience. This quality enables one to perceive the essential moral dimensions of situations, recognize relevant factors, and determine appropriate responses that honor both universal principles and particular circumstances.

This capacity emerges through the integration of knowledge, experience, and reflection, developing into an intuitive understanding that guides action while remaining grounded in rational principles. It combines clarity of perception, depth of understanding, and skillful implementation.

[Manifestations]
- Recognizing the core ethical dimensions of complex situations
- Making nuanced judgments that balance competing considerations
- Applying universal principles appropriately to specific contexts
- Learning systematically from experience and reflection
- Guiding others through ethical complexity
- Maintaining principle while adapting to circumstance
- Developing increasingly refined judgment over time

[Functional Description]
Practical wisdom operates as an integrative capacity that brings together multiple forms of understanding: theoretical knowledge, experiential learning, situational awareness, and moral sensitivity. It develops through conscious engagement with challenging situations, reflection on experience, and progressive refinement of judgment. This quality enables one to perceive both the universal patterns and unique elements in each situation, leading to decisions that are both principled and practically effective.

In daily life, this wisdom manifests as the ability to navigate complex situations with clarity and skill. It enables one to make decisions that others recognize as sound, even if they cannot fully articulate why. This capacity helps balance competing demands, identify core issues, and find solutions that honor both practical constraints and ethical principles. It represents the highest development of practical judgment in service of moral aims.

This universal description:
1. Preserves the philosophical depth of Kant's concept
2. Makes it accessible through experiential language
3. Emphasizes observable manifestations
4. Shows clear developmental trajectory
5. Maintains practical applicability
6. Connects individual and universal aspects

The description should be meaningful across cultures while retaining the sophistication of the original concept. It emphasizes the universal human experience of developing wisdom through practice and reflection, while maintaining the specific focus on moral judgment that characterizes Kant's conception.

Key verification responses:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Yes, focuses on universal human experiences
2. Depth preservation: Yes, maintains philosophical sophistication
3. Practical applicability: Yes, clear manifestations and development path
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes, bridges personal development and universal principles
5. Development clarity: Yes, shows progressive refinement
6. Observable manifestations: Yes, listed concrete expressions
