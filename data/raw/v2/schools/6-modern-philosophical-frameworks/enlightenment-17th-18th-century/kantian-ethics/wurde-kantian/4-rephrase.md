Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Inherent worth of rational beings
Functions: 
- Grounds moral status
- Establishes inviolable rights
- Demands respect
- Creates moral obligations
- Sets absolute value
Systemic role: Foundational principle for ethical treatment
Developmental: Recognition and actualization of inherent worth

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Self-worth recognition
- Respect for human life
- Personal boundaries
- Basic rights consciousness
- Moral agency awareness
Contemporary applications:
- Human rights
- Medical ethics
- Professional conduct
- Social justice
- Personal development

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary relationships:
- To autonomy (source)
- To respect (response)
- To moral law (framework)
- To humanity (scope)

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The inherent and absolute worth present in every human being, which exists independent of circumstance, achievement, or social recognition. This fundamental value creates both rights and responsibilities, demanding recognition and respect while establishing the foundation for moral relationships and ethical treatment.

[Essential Nature]
Human dignity represents an irreducible core of worth that exists prior to and independent of all external factors. Unlike relative forms of value that can be compared, exchanged, or measured, dignity establishes an absolute realm of worth that cannot be calculated or traded. It manifests as both an internal reality to be recognized and an external principle to be honored, creating a bridge between individual self-worth and universal moral status.

This quality operates simultaneously as a fact of human existence and an ideal to be realized, generating both protective boundaries that must not be violated and positive obligations that must be fulfilled. It serves as the foundation for moral consideration and ethical treatment, while also providing the basis for human rights and personal development.

[Manifestations]
- Self-respect and maintenance of personal boundaries
- Recognition and defense of fundamental human rights
- Treating others with unconditional respect regardless of circumstances
- Taking responsibility for one's choices and actions
- Resistance to degradation or instrumentalization
- Development of moral agency and autonomous decision-making
- Creation and maintenance of dignity-preserving environments and relationships

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dual mechanism of recognition and actualization. Recognition involves the conscious awareness of inherent worth in oneself and others, leading to appropriate boundaries and respect. Actualization occurs through choices and actions that honor this worth, developing moral agency and creating conditions for dignity to flourish. Together, these processes establish and maintain the proper moral standing of human beings in relationship to themselves and others.

In practical expression, dignity manifests as a steady maintenance of appropriate boundaries, consistent self-respect, and unwavering recognition of human worth in all contexts. It guides professional conduct, shapes institutional policies, and influences personal relationships. This quality becomes visible in how people carry themselves, treat others, and respond to challenges to their worth or the worth of others. It creates environments where human flourishing becomes possible while preventing degradation and instrumentalization.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: Yes - focuses on universal human experiences of worth and respect
2. Preservation of depth: Yes - maintains philosophical sophistication while increasing accessibility
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear manifestations and applications provided
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - bridges personal experience with universal principle
5. Developmental clarity: Yes - shows both recognition and actualization processes
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - concrete behaviors and patterns identified

The description maintains the philosophical depth of Kant's concept while making it accessible and practical for contemporary application across cultural contexts. It preserves the essential connection between dignity and moral status while emphasizing its lived expression in human experience.
