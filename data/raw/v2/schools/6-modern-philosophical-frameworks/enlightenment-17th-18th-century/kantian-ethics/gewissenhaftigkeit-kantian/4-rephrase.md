```markdown
[Core Definition]
The sustained capacity for thorough moral attention and careful execution that ensures alignment between ethical understanding and action. It manifests as a persistent mindfulness toward moral requirements combined with diligent follow-through, maintaining high standards in both thought and deed.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the bridge between moral awareness and practical action, characterized by careful attention to ethical dimensions in all situations. It operates through systematic self-monitoring, thorough consideration of moral implications, and meticulous execution of responsibilities. More than simple rule-following, it embodies an active, sustained engagement with ethical requirements and their practical fulfillment.

The quality develops through consistent practice of moral attention and systematic self-examination, gradually building an integrated approach to ethical living that becomes second nature. It requires both intellectual rigor and practical discipline, combining clear perception of moral requirements with reliable execution.

[Manifestations]
- Careful consideration before making decisions with ethical implications
- Systematic attention to detail in fulfilling responsibilities
- Regular self-examination of motives and actions
- Reliable follow-through on commitments
- Thorough exploration of moral implications in complex situations
- Consistent alignment between stated principles and actual behavior
- Active maintenance of ethical awareness in daily life

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dual process of sustained attention and careful execution. The attention aspect maintains continuous awareness of moral requirements and implications, while the execution aspect ensures thorough implementation. Together, they create a reliable bridge between ethical understanding and practical action, supported by regular self-examination and systematic reflection.

In practice, this quality manifests as a characteristic thoroughness in moral matters, visible in both major decisions and daily actions. It produces reliability in ethical behavior, consistency between principles and actions, and a reputation for trustworthiness. This thoroughness becomes particularly valuable in professional contexts and complex ethical situations, where careful attention to detail and systematic execution are essential for maintaining high ethical standards.
