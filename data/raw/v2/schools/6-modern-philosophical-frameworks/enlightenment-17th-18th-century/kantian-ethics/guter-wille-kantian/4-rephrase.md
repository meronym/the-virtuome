Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Pure moral intention independent of consequences
Key functions: 
- Grounds moral worth
- Directs rational will
- Enables moral action
- Maintains ethical orientation

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Inner moral compass
- Pure intention
- Ethical commitment
- Fundamental goodness

Common parallels:
- Moral integrity
- Right intention
- Pure heart
- Ethical foundation

Here's my attempt at a universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The fundamental capacity and commitment to recognize, value, and act from genuine moral understanding, independent of external rewards or consequences. It represents the pure intention to do what is right because it is right, forming the foundation of ethical character and moral development.

[Essential Nature]
The foundational moral capacity manifests as an inner orientation toward what is genuinely good and right, operating prior to specific choices or actions. Unlike strategic thinking or emotional impulse, it represents the basic human ability to recognize and commit to moral truth through rational understanding. This quality serves as the source from which all other moral capabilities draw their authentic worth, transforming learned rules and social conventions into genuine ethical insight.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent ethical orientation regardless of circumstances
- Recognition of moral truth independent of personal benefit
- Natural resistance to corrupting influences or rationalizations
- Spontaneous appreciation of genuine moral worth
- Capacity to distinguish between true and apparent good
- Development of increasingly refined moral sensitivity
- Integration of understanding and intention in action

[Functional Description]
This quality operates as an inner compass that precedes and guides specific moral decisions. Rather than calculating consequences or following rules, it enables direct recognition of moral truth through rational insight. It develops through conscious cultivation of moral awareness and repeated commitment to ethical understanding over expedience or advantage.

In practice, it manifests as a stable ethical orientation that remains consistent across contexts and challenges. It enables individuals to maintain moral clarity amid complexity, distinguish genuine moral insights from rationalizations, and act from authentic understanding rather than mere conformity or calculation. This foundation makes possible the development of mature moral character and wisdom.
```

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Yes - focuses on universal human capacity for moral recognition and commitment
2. Preserves depth: Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while using accessible language
3. Practical applicability: Yes - describes observable manifestations and development
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - links personal capacity to universal moral truth
5. Development clarity: Yes - indicates how quality grows through practice and commitment
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - lists concrete expressions and behavioral patterns

The reformulation preserves the sophisticated philosophical foundation of Kant's concept while making it accessible through universal human experiences of moral recognition and commitment. It maintains the crucial distinction between pure moral worth and instrumental calculation while expressing this through observable patterns and practical development.

The description connects individual moral capacity to universal ethical truth while remaining grounded in concrete manifestations and practical development. It preserves the rational foundation while expressing it through experiential rather than theoretical language.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this reformulation to better meet the objectives?
