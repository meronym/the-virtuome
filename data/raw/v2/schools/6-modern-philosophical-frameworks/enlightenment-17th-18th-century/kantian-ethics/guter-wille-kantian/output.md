[Core Definition]
The fundamental capacity and commitment to recognize, value, and act from genuine moral understanding, independent of external rewards or consequences. It represents the pure intention to do what is right because it is right, forming the foundation of ethical character and moral development.

[Essential Nature]
The foundational moral capacity manifests as an inner orientation toward what is genuinely good and right, operating prior to specific choices or actions. Unlike strategic thinking or emotional impulse, it represents the basic human ability to recognize and commit to moral truth through rational understanding. This quality serves as the source from which all other moral capabilities draw their authentic worth, transforming learned rules and social conventions into genuine ethical insight.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent ethical orientation regardless of circumstances
- Recognition of moral truth independent of personal benefit
- Natural resistance to corrupting influences or rationalizations
- Spontaneous appreciation of genuine moral worth
- Capacity to distinguish between true and apparent good
- Development of increasingly refined moral sensitivity
- Integration of understanding and intention in action

[Functional Description]
This quality operates as an inner compass that precedes and guides specific moral decisions. Rather than calculating consequences or following rules, it enables direct recognition of moral truth through rational insight. It develops through conscious cultivation of moral awareness and repeated commitment to ethical understanding over expedience or advantage.

In practice, it manifests as a stable ethical orientation that remains consistent across contexts and challenges. It enables individuals to maintain moral clarity amid complexity, distinguish genuine moral insights from rationalizations, and act from authentic understanding rather than mere conformity or calculation. This foundation makes possible the development of mature moral character and wisdom.
