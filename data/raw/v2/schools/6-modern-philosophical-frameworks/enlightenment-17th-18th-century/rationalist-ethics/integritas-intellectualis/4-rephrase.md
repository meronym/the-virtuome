Let me first analyze the concept following the preparation framework:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Alignment between thought, truth-seeking, and action
Key functions: 
- Truth verification
- Internal consistency maintenance
- Honest self-examination
- Commitment to reality-based understanding
Systemic role: Foundation for reliable knowledge and ethical thinking
Developmental aspects: Progressive refinement of truthful orientation

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences:
- Inner sense of truth vs. falsehood
- Struggle between convenience and honesty
- Need for reliable understanding
- Experience of cognitive dissonance
Contemporary relevance:
- Information age challenges
- Need for reliable knowledge
- Professional ethics
- Scientific integrity

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity and commitment to align one's thinking, communication, and action with what one genuinely understands to be true, maintaining consistency between inner recognition of truth and outer expression while persistently refining one's understanding through honest examination.

[Essential Nature]
Intellectual integrity operates as an inner compass that continuously orients consciousness toward truth and authentic understanding. It manifests as an active force that maintains alignment between what we perceive as true, what we express, and how we act. This quality combines receptivity to truth with the courage to face it, creating a dynamic balance between humility in recognizing our limitations and determination in pursuing clearer understanding.

Beyond mere honesty, it represents the mind's commitment to reality itself, functioning as both a truth-seeking and truth-maintaining capacity. It requires constant vigilance against self-deception while fostering progressive refinement of understanding through systematic self-correction.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent alignment between private understanding and public expression
- Regular self-examination of assumptions and beliefs
- Immediate recognition and correction of inconsistencies
- Openness to evidence that challenges current views
- Precise acknowledgment of the limits of one's knowledge
- Integration of new understanding into existing knowledge framework
- Active resistance to self-deception and convenient falsehoods

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through continuous internal monitoring that compares current understanding with incoming information, expressed views, and contemplated actions. It creates a dynamic feedback loop between truth recognition, expression, and behavior, automatically detecting misalignments and generating pressure toward resolution. When fully developed, it becomes an automatic calibration system that maintains cognitive authenticity while driving deeper understanding.

In practical expression, intellectual integrity manifests as careful speech that precisely matches understanding, willingness to admit errors and limitations, and consistent effort to verify and improve one's knowledge. It enables reliable thinking and communication while fostering trust in collaborative contexts. This quality particularly shows itself in moments of challenge, when maintaining truth alignment requires personal cost or effort.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the rationalist emphasis on truth and systematic thinking
2. Translates theoretical concepts into experiential terms
3. Highlights practical manifestations and development
4. Connects individual practice to universal human experience
5. Maintains sophistication while improving accessibility
6. Provides clear markers for observation and verification

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
