Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to perceive, understand, and work with the interconnected nature of reality. It enables one to recognize patterns, integrate diverse elements into coherent wholes, and navigate complexity through understanding underlying principles and relationships. This quality transforms scattered knowledge into meaningful understanding.

[Essential Nature]
Systematic understanding emerges from our natural ability to recognize patterns and make connections, developed to a higher level of conscious competence. It operates through simultaneous awareness of both details and their broader context, allowing us to grasp how elements interact within larger wholes. This quality combines analytical precision with synthetic vision, enabling us to build coherent mental models of complex realities.

This understanding isn't merely intellectual but deeply practical, providing frameworks for effective action and decision-making. It transforms our relationship with complexity from overwhelming to navigable, and enables us to work with systems rather than against them.

[Manifestations]
- Recognizing meaningful patterns in complex situations
- Building coherent mental models of how things work
- Seeing connections between seemingly unrelated elements
- Understanding how specific actions influence larger systems
- Moving fluently between details and big picture
- Making effective decisions in complex situations
- Teaching others through clear frameworks and principles

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through an iterative process of observation, pattern recognition, and model building. It begins with noticing simple relationships and gradually expands to encompass more complex systems. As it develops, our perception naturally starts organizing information into coherent frameworks, making complexity manageable and meaningful. The mind becomes adept at recognizing both patterns and exceptions, continuously refining its understanding.

In practice, systematic understanding manifests as an enhanced ability to navigate complex situations, make informed decisions, and solve problems effectively. It enables us to anticipate consequences, understand indirect effects, and work productively with complex systems. This quality transforms overwhelming complexity into manageable challenges, providing practical wisdom for both everyday situations and specialized domains.

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural? Yes - based on universal human cognitive capabilities
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophistication while increasing accessibility
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear connection to real-world challenges
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal development to universal patterns
5. Development clear? Yes - shows progression from simple to complex
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - concrete behavioral indicators provided

The description maintains the philosophical depth of rationalist systematic understanding while making it accessible and practical for contemporary contexts.
