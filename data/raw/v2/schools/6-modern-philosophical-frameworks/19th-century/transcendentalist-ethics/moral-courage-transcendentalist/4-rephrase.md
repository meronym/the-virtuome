```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to act decisively and maintain ethical stance despite personal risk or social pressure, translating moral conviction into concrete action when facing opposition. This quality bridges internal moral clarity with external expression, enabling individuals and groups to manifest their principles despite adversity.

[Essential Nature]
Moral courage represents the active integration of ethical understanding with practical will, manifesting when one's recognition of right action meets external resistance. Unlike physical courage which confronts tangible threats, moral courage navigates the subtle pressures of social disapproval, personal loss, and institutional opposition. It serves as the essential bridge between moral insight and moral action, transforming private conviction into public reality.

[Manifestations]
- Speaking truth to power despite potential consequences
- Maintaining ethical stance when socially isolated
- Taking action to protect others' wellbeing at personal cost 
- Resisting group pressure to participate in wrong
- Publicly standing for principles despite ridicule
- Sacrificing advantages to maintain integrity
- Initiating necessary but difficult changes

[Functional Description]
Moral courage develops through progressive stages, beginning with personal integrity in private decisions and expanding to public ethical action. It requires the cultivation of three elements: clear moral discernment, emotional resilience, and practiced will. These combine to create the capacity for sustained ethical action despite opposition. The quality strengthens through exercise, with each courageous act building capacity for future ethical challenges.

In practice, moral courage manifests as a dynamic response to ethical challenges, providing the force needed to overcome both internal resistance and external pressure. It operates as a catalyst for positive change, enabling individuals to serve as ethical agents in their communities and breaking cycles of collective moral compromise. This quality proves essential for both personal integrity and social progress, acting as the practical foundation for moral development at all scales.

3. Practical applicability: Clear examples and developmental pathway
4. Individual-Universal connection: Links personal integrity to social change
5. Developmental clarity: Shows progression from personal to public courage
6. Observable manifestations: All listed expressions are concrete and verifiable

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
