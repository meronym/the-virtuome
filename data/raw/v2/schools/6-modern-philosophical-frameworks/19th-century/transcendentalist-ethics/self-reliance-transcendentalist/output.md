[Functional Description]
Self-reliance operates through the continuous interplay between direct experience, independent judgment, and responsible action. As insights arise from personal experience, they are tested through practical application, refined through reflection, and integrated into deepening understanding. This creates an expanding spiral of capability and confidence, strengthening both discernment and effectiveness while maintaining openness to new learning.

In practice, this quality enables individuals to navigate complexity with increasing wisdom, contribute original value, and develop authentic capabilities. It supports innovation and leadership by combining receptivity to direct experience with the courage to act on personal understanding.
