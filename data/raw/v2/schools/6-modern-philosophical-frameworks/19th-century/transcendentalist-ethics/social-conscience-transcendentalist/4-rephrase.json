Core Principles of Transcendentalism:\n- Individual intuitive capacity to perceive truth\n- Direct relationship with divine/transcendent reality\n- Nature as spiritual teacher and mirror\n- Self-reliance as path to authentic living\n- Reform of self and society as interconnected goals\n\n2. Key Considerations:\n- Must capture both individual and social dimensions\n- Should reflect both contemplative and active aspects\n- Need to represent both natural and spiritual elements\n- Should show progression from personal to universal\n- Must maintain internal coherence of their system\n\n3. Structural Analysis:\nTranscendentalist virtues typically operate in connected layers:\n- Individual internal (self-knowledge)\n- Individual external (authentic action)\n- Natural connection (ecological wisdom)\n- Social engagement (reform activity)\n- Universal/Transcendent (higher truth)\n\n4. Selection Criteria:\n- Foundational importance to the tradition\n- Representativeness of key principles\n- Practical applicability\n- Interconnectedness with other virtues\n- Documentary evidence in core texts\n\nPROPOSED SHORTLIST:\n\n1. Self-Reliance (self-trust, independence)\n- The cornerstone virtue from which others flow\n- Central to Emerson's philosophy\n- Foundation for authentic living\n\n2. Authenticity (genuine self-expression)\n- Natural extension of self-reliance\n- Key to transcendentalist self-culture\n- Bridge between inner truth and outer action\n\n3.

Conscious Simplicity (deliberate living)\n- Practical expression of natural wisdom\n- Key to both personal and social reform\n- Central to Thoreau's philosophy\n\n5. Moral Courage (principled action)\n- Active expression of self-reliance\n- Necessary for social reform\n- Exemplified in civil disobedience\n\n6.

Social Conscience (reform mindedness)\n- Links individual growth to social progress\n- Essential for community development\n- Expresses universal human dignity\n\n9. Contemplative Action (mindful engagement)\n- Unifies thought and deed\n- Bridges personal and social reform\n- Exemplifies practical idealism\n\nThis shortlist captures the essential progression of Transcendentalist virtue:\n- Starting with self-reliance\n- Moving through personal authenticity\n- Connecting with natural wisdom\n- Expressing in simplified living\n- Acting with moral courage\n- Maintaining spiritual awareness\n- Creating with independence\n- Engaging in social reform\n- Integration through mindful action\n\nEach virtue builds upon and reinforces the others, creating a coherent system for personal and social development that remains true to Transcendentalist principles while offering practical guidance for living.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these nine core virtues?"
