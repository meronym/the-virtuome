Let me follow the analytical process and then provide the universalized description.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Openness to direct experience of transcendent reality
Key functions: 
- Recognition of deeper dimensions of experience
- Direct perception beyond conceptual understanding
- Integration of insights into daily life
- Bridge between personal and universal

Relationship patterns:
- Grounds other virtues in deeper understanding
- Enables authentic self-knowledge
- Facilitates natural wisdom
- Supports contemplative action

UNIVERSALIZATION ANALYSIS:
Universal experiences:
- Moments of profound insight/clarity
- Experiences of deep connection/unity
- Sense of meaning beyond ordinary perception
- Direct knowing beyond rational thought

Cross-cultural parallels:
- Mindfulness/presence practices
- Contemplative traditions
- Nature connection practices
- Direct experiential knowing

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to remain open to and recognize deeper dimensions of reality through direct experience, characterized by receptive awareness that transcends ordinary perception and conceptual understanding. This quality enables recognition of underlying patterns, meanings, and connections in both personal and universal experience.

[Essential Nature]
Spiritual receptivity represents the human capacity for direct, unmediated experience of reality beyond conventional understanding. It manifests as an alert openness that allows deeper patterns and meanings to emerge naturally in awareness, rather than being constructed through thought. This quality combines profound receptiveness with clear recognition, enabling both subtle perception and practical integration of insights.

This receptivity operates at multiple levels simultaneously: in immediate sensory experience, in recognition of meaning and pattern, and in direct awareness of underlying reality. It develops through cultivating both deep attention and the ability to hold experience without immediately conceptualizing it.

[Manifestations]
- Sustained openness to present experience without premature categorization
- Recognition of meaningful patterns and connections beyond surface appearances
- Direct insight into the nature of reality and human experience
- Integration of profound understanding with practical living
- Natural emergence of wisdom and clarity in daily situations
- Deepening capacity for genuine presence and authentic response
- Recognition of universal principles in particular experiences

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a combination of profound openness and clear recognition. It begins with releasing habitual patterns of conceptual overlay, allowing direct experience to reveal itself more fully. As this capacity develops, it enables recognition of deeper patterns and principles operating in all experience, leading to natural wisdom and appropriate response. This process involves both letting go of predetermined understanding and cultivating subtle attention to what is actually present.

In practical terms, spiritual receptivity manifests as an enhanced ability to perceive and respond to situations with greater depth and clarity. It supports authentic understanding and action by providing direct access to deeper dimensions of experience, while maintaining practical groundedness. This quality develops through practice in maintaining open awareness while engaging fully with life's activities, gradually revealing the profound in the ordinary.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the depth of the Transcendentalist understanding while making it accessible
2. Connects to universal human experiences and capacities
3. Maintains practical relevance and applicability
4. Links individual experience to universal principles
5. Describes observable manifestations and development
6. Avoids culture-specific religious or philosophical terminology
7. Emphasizes experiential understanding over theoretical framework

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this description?
