Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Creative force that generates new values and meanings
Functions: Cultural innovation, personal transformation, meaning-making
Systemic role: Generative force enabling evolution of values and culture
Developmental: Moves from personal expression to cultural transformation

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- The urge to create and innovate
- The drive to make meaning
- The capacity to envision and manifest new possibilities
- The need to transform existing patterns

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary elements:
- Generative force (essence)
- Creative manifestation (expression)
- Value-creation (function)
- Cultural transformation (impact)

Here's my universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The fundamental human capacity to generate new forms of meaning, value, and possibility through creative action. It manifests as the power to envision and bring forth what has not existed before, transforming both self and world through the act of creation.

[Essential Nature]
Creative force represents the generative power inherent in human consciousness that enables us to transcend existing patterns and manifest new realities. It operates at multiple levels: personal (self-creation), interpersonal (cultural innovation), and universal (value generation). This force isn't limited to artistic expression but encompasses all forms of meaningful innovationâ€”from new ideas and values to new ways of being and relating.

This quality embodies the human capacity to participate actively in the evolution of consciousness and culture, rather than merely inheriting and maintaining existing forms. It represents the point where individual creativity intersects with cultural transformation.

[Manifestations]
- Artistic creation: Bringing forth new forms of beauty and meaning
- Conceptual innovation: Generating new ideas and frameworks
- Value creation: Establishing new standards and ideals
- Cultural transformation: Reshaping collective patterns and meanings
- Personal reinvention: Consciously recreating oneself
- Practical innovation: Developing new solutions and approaches
- Meaning-making: Generating fresh interpretations and significance

[Functional Description]
This creative force operates through a dynamic interplay between vision and manifestation. It begins with the capacity to perceive possibilities beyond current reality, combines with the courage to act on these visions, and culminates in the practical ability to bring new forms into being. The process involves both destruction of outdated patterns and construction of new ones, requiring both imagination and practical capability.

In daily life, this force expresses itself whenever we move beyond mere reaction or repetition to generate something genuinely new. It appears in moments of insight, in acts of artistic creation, in the development of new solutions to problems, and in the conscious reshaping of our own patterns of being. Its impact extends from personal transformation to cultural evolution, making it a fundamental driver of human development and social progress.
```

This universalization:
1. Preserves the Nietzschean emphasis on creative power and value-generation
2. Makes the concept accessible through common human experiences
3. Maintains philosophical sophistication while using phenomenological language
4. Links individual creative capacity to cultural transformation
5. Provides clear markers for practical manifestation
6. Establishes relevance across different domains of human activity

The description passes verification questions by:
- Using universal human experiences of creativity and innovation
- Maintaining the depth of Nietzsche's concept of creative force
- Providing clear practical applications
- Connecting individual creative capacity to universal transformation
- Outlining developmental progression
- Offering observable manifestations
