Let me follow the process systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Creative self-expansion and enhancement
Functions: Growth driver, self-overcoming mechanism, creative force
Systemic role: Fundamental motivating force, basis for development
Developmental aspects: From basic drive to refined creative force

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Drive for mastery and competence
- Creative urge
- Growth impulse
- Achievement motivation
- Self-actualization tendency

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary: Life-affirming creative force manifesting as growth
Secondary: Resistance to stagnation, need for challenge

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The fundamental drive toward creative growth and enhanced capability, manifesting as the impulse to develop, master, and transcend current limitations. This quality expresses itself through active engagement with challenges, continuous self-development, and the creative transformation of self and environment.

[Essential Nature]
At its core, this quality represents the inherent tendency of life toward greater complexity, capability, and expression. Unlike simple dominance or control, it manifests as creative mastery - the power to shape, develop, and transform. It operates through engaging with resistance and challenges, turning obstacles into opportunities for growth.

This creative force seeks not mere preservation but enhancement, not static achievement but continuous development. It represents the dynamic principle through which potential becomes actual, expressing itself differently at various levels of refinement - from basic competence-seeking to artistic creation and cultural innovation.

[Manifestations]
- Persistent drive to develop skills and capabilities
- Creative engagement with challenges and obstacles
- Continuous self-improvement and personal growth
- Leadership through enhancement rather than domination
- Cultural and artistic innovation
- Transformation of difficulties into growth opportunities
- Mastery-oriented approach to activities and relationships

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay between current capabilities and potential development, activated by engaging with resistance and challenges. Rather than avoiding obstacles, it transforms them into growth opportunities. The process involves identifying areas for development, actively engaging with challenges, and integrating new capabilities into an expanded sense of self.

In practical expression, this manifests as the drive to master skills, create art, build organizations, develop ideas, or enhance relationships. It appears in the athlete's pursuit of excellence, the artist's drive to create, the leader's vision for growth, and the thinker's push for deeper understanding. The quality becomes increasingly refined as it develops, moving from raw ambition to sophisticated creative expression and cultural contribution.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: Links to universal human experiences of growth and mastery
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible
3. Practical applicability: Clear connections to various domains of human activity
4. Individual-universal connection: Links personal growth to broader creative force
5. Developmental clarity: Shows progression from basic drive to refined expression
6. Observable manifestations: Concrete examples in multiple domains

The description maintains the philosophical sophistication of Nietzsche's concept while making it accessible and practical, focusing on the creative and developmental aspects rather than potentially problematic power dynamics. It emphasizes the quality's role in personal growth and cultural creation while remaining culturally neutral.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
