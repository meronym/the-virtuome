Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Autonomous capacity for independent thought and value-creation
Key functions: 
- Liberation from inherited/conventional frameworks
- Development of independent judgment
- Creation of authentic values
- Integration of multiple perspectives
Systemic role: Enables authentic self-development and cultural innovation

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Discovery of personal truth
- Breaking free from limiting beliefs
- Finding one's own path
- Creating meaning independently
Contemporary relevance:
- Information age critical thinking
- Multicultural navigation
- Personal authenticity
- Ethical leadership

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary elements:
- Mental sovereignty
- Value-creating capacity
- Interpretive freedom
- Cultural independence

Here's my universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The developed capacity to think, evaluate, and create meaning independently while maintaining genuine openness to multiple perspectives and possibilities. It combines critical discernment with creative freedom, enabling authentic understanding and value-creation beyond conventional frameworks.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the mind's mature capability for genuine independence combined with deep receptivity. It manifests as the ability to examine beliefs critically, generate authentic insights, and create valid meanings without being unconsciously bound by inherited frameworks or conventional wisdom. Unlike mere rebelliousness or isolation, it enables meaningful engagement with multiple viewpoints while maintaining autonomous judgment.

This sovereignty of mind emerges through the integration of critical thinking, creative insight, and authentic self-trust. It requires both the strength to stand apart from consensus and the wisdom to remain open to truth from any source.

[Manifestations]
- Ability to examine beliefs and assumptions without fear or attachment
- Capacity to hold multiple perspectives while maintaining clear judgment
- Creative generation of new interpretations and meanings
- Independent evaluation of ideas based on their merit rather than their source
- Integration of diverse insights without losing autonomous discernment
- Development of authentic values aligned with deeper understanding
- Expression of original thoughts while remaining open to dialogue

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive liberation from unconscious mental constraints combined with growing capacity for independent insight. It begins with questioning inherited assumptions, advances through development of critical thinking and interpretive skills, and matures into the ability to create valid meanings and values. This process requires courage to face uncertainty, strength to stand alone when necessary, and wisdom to remain open to truth in all forms.

In practice, it enables navigation of complex intellectual and cultural landscapes while maintaining authentic perspective. It supports leadership in thought and culture, enables genuine innovation, and facilitates bridge-building between different worldviews. This mental sovereignty creates space for both independent judgment and meaningful dialogue, supporting both personal development and cultural evolution.

This universalization maintains the core insights of Nietzsche's concept while making them accessible across cultural contexts. It preserves:
- The emphasis on genuine independence
- The creative/generative aspect
- The distinction from mere rebellion
- The connection to personal authenticity
- The cultural/developmental dimension

While adding:
- More explicit connection to universal human experience
- Clearer developmental trajectory
- More accessible language
- Broader practical applications
- Contemporary relevance
