Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF STOLZ:

Core Principle:
- Healthy self-valuation based on genuine merit
- Integration of achievement and character
- Balance between self-respect and humility
- Recognition of earned dignity

Key Functions:
- Maintains healthy self-worth
- Motivates excellence

Now, transforming this into universal language:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The mature integration of genuine achievement with balanced self-worth, manifesting as dignified self-respect that enables both personal excellence and generous leadership. This quality combines clear recognition of one's capabilities and accomplishments with the wisdom to hold them in proper perspective.

[Essential Nature]
Earned dignity represents the natural culmination of sustained development and genuine achievement, manifesting as a quiet confidence that needs neither inflation nor diminishment. Unlike mere pride or status-seeking, it emerges from the authentic integration of one's capabilities, accomplishments, and character into a coherent sense of self-worth. This quality enables both continued growth and generous leadership, as it rests on solid foundation rather than comparative validation.

This mature self-valuation transcends both arrogance and false modesty, allowing one to acknowledge genuine merit while maintaining perspective on one's place within larger contexts. It functions as an internal compass that guides appropriate self-assertion while fostering respect for others' dignity.

[Manifestations]
- Quiet confidence without need for external validation
- Graceful acknowledgment of genuine accomplishments
- Natural authority that empowers rather than diminishes others
- Generous recognition of others' achievements
- Appropriate self-assertion balanced with genuine humility
- Dignified conduct in both success and adversity
- Leadership that elevates others while maintaining clear standards

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive integration of genuine accomplishments with deepening self-knowledge. It begins with discrete achievements and their recognition, matures through challenges and setbacks that test and temper initial pride, and culminates in a stable self-valuation that transcends circumstantial successes or failures. This process requires both the courage to acknowledge real merit and the wisdom to maintain perspective.

In practice, earned dignity enables effective leadership by combining clear standards with genuine respect for others' potential. It manifests in the natural authority of those who have integrated their capabilities and accomplishments into mature self-worth, allowing them to maintain high standards while fostering growth in others. This balance creates environments where excellence and mutual respect reinforce each other, supporting both individual development and collective achievement.

This universalization aims to:
- Capture the philosophical depth of Nietzsche's concept
- Make it accessible across cultural contexts
- Maintain practical applicability
- Connect individual development to social impact
- Preserve the nuanced balance of the original idea
- Enable practical development and assessment

The description focuses on observable manifestations while preserving the sophisticated understanding of how this quality develops and functions. It emphasizes the experiential aspects while maintaining conceptual precision.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
