Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Selbst√ºberwindung:
- Core principle: Active self-transcendence
- Primary function: Development through challenge
- Systemic role: Driver of human evolution/development
- Key patterns: Cyclical growth through resistance

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Pushing beyond comfort zones
- Breaking through limitations
- Personal transformation
- Achievement through effort
- Growth through challenge

Parallel concepts:
- Self-actualization (psychology)
- Personal cultivation (Eastern traditions)
- Spiritual transformation (mystical traditions)
- Athletic transcendence (sports/performance)
- Creative breakthrough (arts)

Here's my attempt at a universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The active capacity to transcend one's current limitations through conscious effort and challenge, manifesting as an ongoing process of growth where each achievement becomes the foundation for further development. This fundamental drive transforms obstacles into opportunities for expansion of capabilities and consciousness.

[Essential Nature]
Self-transcendence operates as a dynamic spiral of development where internal resistance and external challenges become catalysts for growth. It represents the conscious embodiment of life's inherent tendency toward increasing complexity and capability, expressed through deliberate engagement with limitation and difficulty. This quality manifests as both momentary breakthrough experiences and sustained developmental trajectories, always maintaining the tension between current capacity and emerging potential.

At its core, this quality combines recognition of limitation with the creative force to move beyond it, transforming the natural human growth impulse into conscious self-direction. It requires both the humility to acknowledge current boundaries and the courage to challenge them, operating through cycles of stability, challenge, breakthrough, and integration.

[Manifestations]
Primary Expressions:
- Voluntary engagement with difficulty beyond current capacity
- Systematic development of skills and capabilities
- Breakthrough moments of exceeding perceived limitations
- Integration of new capacities as foundation for further growth
- Transformation of obstacles into opportunities for development
- Recognition and transcendence of psychological barriers
- Active seeking of appropriate challenges for growth

Developmental Sequence:
1. Recognition of current limitations
2. Conscious engagement with challenge
3. Sustained effort through difficulty
4. Breakthrough and expansion
5. Integration and stabilization
6. Recognition of new frontier
7. Renewal of growth cycle

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay between stability and challenge, where conscious engagement with difficulty catalyzes expansion of capability. It functions by maintaining optimal tension between current capacity and emerging potential, utilizing resistance and obstacle as essential elements of growth. The process requires both active will and receptive awareness, combining directed effort with organic development patterns.

In practical expression, this manifests as deliberate engagement with challenging activities, systematic skill development, and conscious pushing of personal boundaries. It appears in physical training, skill acquisition, creative work, intellectual development, and psychological growth. Success requires balancing challenge with capacity, maintaining sustainable growth trajectories while allowing for breakthrough moments. The quality develops through conscious practice, gradually increasing one's ability to engage with and transcend limitations across multiple domains of experience.

This universalized description aims to:
- Preserve the active/dynamic nature of the original concept
- Connect it to universal human experience
- Maintain philosophical sophistication
- Provide practical understanding
- Show clear developmental patterns
- Indicate observable manifestations

The description avoids:
- Culture-specific references
- Overly abstract language
- Theoretical frameworks
- Specialized terminology

Would you like me to adjust any aspect to better meet the objectives?
