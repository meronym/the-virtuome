Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Seelenstärke:

Core principle: Internal fortitude that combines resilience, sovereignty, and depth
Key functions:
- Emotional regulation
- Self-containment
- Stress resistance
- Recovery capacity
- Internal stability

Systemic role:
- Foundation for other virtues
- Buffer against adversity
- Source of authentic action
- Base for psychological independence

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:

Universal experiences:
- Facing adversity
- Managing internal states
- Maintaining integrity under pressure
- Recovering from setbacks
- Developing internal resources

Contemporary parallels:
- Psychological resilience
- Emotional intelligence
- Mental toughness

Here's my attempt at the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Inner strength manifesting as the capacity to maintain psychological sovereignty and integrity while facing life's challenges. It combines emotional resilience, internal stability, and the power to recover and grow through adversity, forming the foundation for authentic self-expression and meaningful action.

[Essential Nature]
Inner strength emerges from the development of robust internal structures that enable both stability and flexibility in response to life's demands. It represents the cultivation of a strong psychological core that maintains integrity under pressure while remaining permeable enough to grow through experience. This quality combines firmness with adaptability, creating a dynamic stability that supports both resilience and growth.

This strength is not rigid defensiveness but rather a vital, responsive capacity that allows one to remain centered and self-directed while engaging fully with life's challenges and opportunities. It manifests as a felt sense of internal solidity combined with the ability to flow with experience without losing one's center.

[Manifestations]
- Maintaining emotional equilibrium during challenging circumstances
- Quick recovery from setbacks with enhanced understanding
- Calm strength that contains and processes intense experiences
- Clear boundaries without rigid defensiveness
- Authentic self-expression even under social pressure
- Capacity to hold and integrate difficult experiences
- Balance of receptivity and firmness in facing challenges

[Functional Description]
Inner strength operates through a dynamic interplay of stabilizing and adaptive mechanisms. The stabilizing aspect maintains core integrity and continuity of self, while the adaptive aspect enables flexible response to changing conditions. This creates a resilient internal foundation that can absorb impact, process experience, and maintain functionality under stress while continuing to develop and refine itself through engagement with challenges.

In practical terms, this quality enables one to face difficult situations without becoming overwhelmed or losing authentic connection to oneself. It allows for full engagement with life's challenges while maintaining internal coherence and the capacity for growth. This strength manifests as a tangible presence that others can sense and rely upon, contributing to both personal development and positive influence in relationships and communities.

This universalized description aims to:
- Capture the phenomenological essence of Seelenstärke
- Make it accessible across cultural contexts
- Preserve its sophistication and depth
- Connect individual experience to universal patterns
- Maintain practical applicability
- Include both stability and development aspects
- Address both internal experience and external manifestation
