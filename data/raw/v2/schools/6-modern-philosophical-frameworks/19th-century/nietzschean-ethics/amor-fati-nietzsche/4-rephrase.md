Let me follow the process systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Radical acceptance transformed into active love
Key functions: 
- Transforms suffering into strength
- Converts necessity into freedom
- Transmutes resistance into embrace
Relations: Links to resilience, wisdom, joy
Developmental: Progresses from acceptance → understanding → love

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Facing unchangeable circumstances
- Finding peace with difficult realities
- Discovering freedom within constraints
- Transforming attitude toward necessity

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary: Transformative acceptance leading to liberation
Secondary: Resistance to fate → Understanding → Integration → Love

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to fully embrace and find joy in life exactly as it is, transforming even life's hardships into objects of love and sources of growth. This quality represents the ultimate alchemy of human consciousness: the power to transmute necessity into freedom through total acceptance and active love.

[Essential Nature]
This quality operates as a transformative force that fundamentally alters our relationship with reality itself. It begins with deep acceptance of what cannot be changed, progresses through understanding of life's necessary patterns, and culminates in an active love for the entirety of existence. Unlike mere resignation or passive acceptance, it represents a dynamic, creative embrace that transforms both the lover and the loved.

This transformation occurs through a profound shift in consciousness where the distinction between what we want and what must be gradually dissolves, revealing a deeper freedom within apparent constraint. It manifests as an increasing capacity to find joy and meaning not despite life's challenges, but precisely through them.

[Manifestations]
- Profound peace in the face of unchangeable circumstances
- Spontaneous joy arising from full acceptance of present reality
- Creative engagement with limitations and constraints
- Transformation of personal suffering into sources of meaning
- Discovery of freedom within apparent necessity
- Radiating warmth toward life's full spectrum of experiences
- Integration of opposition into larger patterns of meaning

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through stages of increasingly deep engagement with life's necessities. It begins with acceptance of what cannot be changed, deepens through understanding of necessity's role in growth, and culminates in active love for the whole of existence. The transformation occurs through repeated acts of embracing rather than resisting, gradually building capacity for finding joy within apparent constraint.

In practical terms, this quality manifests as an unusual resilience and creativity in facing life's challenges. Those embodying it exhibit remarkable ability to find opportunity in obstacle, meaning in difficulty, and joy in the midst of struggle. This isn't achieved through denial or detachment, but through deeper engagement with reality itself. The result is a distinctive combination of unshakeable peace and dynamic engagement with life.

This universalization maintains the philosophical depth of amor fati while making it accessible through common human experiences. It preserves the transformative aspect central to Nietzsche's concept while expressing it in phenomenological rather than theoretical terms. The description connects individual experience to universal patterns and provides clear indicators of how this quality manifests and develops.

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural? Yes - focuses on universal human experience of necessity
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains transformative aspect and philosophical sophistication
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear manifestations and development path
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal transformation to universal patterns
5. Development clear? Yes - shows progression through stages
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - concrete behavioral and attitudinal indicators

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
