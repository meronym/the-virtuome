[Core Definition]
The capacity to learn from experience through careful observation and systematic testing, combining curious investigation with practical judgment to understand what truly works. It enables reliable navigation of reality through evidence-based understanding rather than assumption or theory alone.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the marriage of careful observation with practical wisdom, enabling one to build reliable knowledge through direct experience and systematic investigation. It manifests as a grounded approach to understanding that values evidence over speculation, results over theories, and actual outcomes over intended effects. This quality develops through conscious attention to cause and effect, willingness to test assumptions, and systematic reflection on experience.

[Manifestations]
- Careful observation of results and outcomes in any endeavor
- Regular testing of assumptions against actual experience
- Systematic collection and analysis of practical feedback
- Adjustment of approaches based on verified results
- Building knowledge through documented experience
- Pattern recognition across multiple instances
- Integration of theoretical understanding with practical testing

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous cycle of observation, testing, and refinement. It begins with careful attention to what actually happens (rather than what should happen), develops through systematic investigation of cause and effect, and matures into reliable judgment based on accumulated verified experience. The process requires both curiosity to investigate and discipline to verify.

In practice, it enables increasingly reliable decision-making and effective action through grounded understanding of how things actually work. It manifests as the ability to predict practical outcomes, design effective solutions, and guide others based on verified experience rather than untested theory. This quality serves as a bridge between abstract understanding and practical effectiveness.
