Let me follow the systematic process for universalizing "Empirical Prudence."

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Evidence-based wisdom in decision-making
Key functions:
- Observation of outcomes
- Pattern recognition
- Reality testing
- Practical verification
- Learning from experience

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Learning from trial and error
- Testing assumptions
- Observing cause and effect
- Adjusting based on feedback
- Building practical knowledge

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary:
- Grounded discernment
- Practical investigation
- Systematic learning
- Reality-based judgment

Secondary:
- Confirmation bias
- Wishful thinking
- Need for verification
- Practical testing

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to learn from experience through careful observation and systematic testing, combining curious investigation with practical judgment to understand what truly works. It enables reliable navigation of reality through evidence-based understanding rather than assumption or theory alone.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the marriage of careful observation with practical wisdom, enabling one to build reliable knowledge through direct experience and systematic investigation. It manifests as a grounded approach to understanding that values evidence over speculation, results over theories, and actual outcomes over intended effects. This quality develops through conscious attention to cause and effect, willingness to test assumptions, and systematic reflection on experience.

[Manifestations]
- Careful observation of results and outcomes in any endeavor
- Regular testing of assumptions against actual experience
- Systematic collection and analysis of practical feedback
- Adjustment of approaches based on verified results
- Building knowledge through documented experience
- Pattern recognition across multiple instances
- Integration of theoretical understanding with practical testing

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a continuous cycle of observation, testing, and refinement. It begins with careful attention to what actually happens (rather than what should happen), develops through systematic investigation of cause and effect, and matures into reliable judgment based on accumulated verified experience. The process requires both curiosity to investigate and discipline to verify.

In practice, it enables increasingly reliable decision-making and effective action through grounded understanding of how things actually work. It manifests as the ability to predict practical outcomes, design effective solutions, and guide others based on verified experience rather than untested theory. This quality serves as a bridge between abstract understanding and practical effectiveness.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the core meaning of empirical investigation and practical wisdom
2. Connects to universal human experiences of learning from experience
3. Maintains practical applicability across contexts
4. Uses phenomenological rather than theoretical language
5. Shows clear developmental progression
6. Provides observable manifestations
7. Links individual practice to universal principles

The description should be meaningful across cultures as it relates to universal human experiences of learning from observation and experience. It preserves the sophisticated empirical approach while making it accessible through common experiences of testing and verification.

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universalization further?
