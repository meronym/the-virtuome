Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Public Spirit:
Core principle: Active engagement with collective wellbeing
Key functions: 
- Connecting individual to collective
- Motivating social participation
- Enabling collective action
- Fostering social responsibility
Systemic role: Bridge between personal and communal flourishing

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Community belonging
- Collective problem-solving
- Shared responsibility
- Group achievement
- Social contribution

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Primary Elements:
- Core: Conscious participation in collective life
- Manifestation: Active contribution to community
- Development: From awareness to engagement to leadership
- Relations: Links individual growth to social progress

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The conscious capacity to perceive, care for, and actively participate in the wellbeing of the broader human community. It manifests as an expanding sense of responsibility and agency that connects personal development with collective flourishing, driving meaningful contribution to shared life.

[Essential Nature]
Public spirit represents the awakening and maturation of our inherent social consciousness. It's the quality through which individuals recognize their interconnection with and responsibility to the larger human community, transforming abstract awareness into practical engagement. This capacity enables us to perceive collective needs, understand social dynamics, and channel personal resources toward shared wellbeing.

Beyond mere civic duty or social obligation, it embodies the natural flowering of human consciousness from individual to collective awareness, expressing our fundamental nature as social beings capable of coordinated action and shared achievement.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous attention to collective needs and opportunities
- Natural inclination to contribute skills and resources to shared causes
- Active participation in community improvement initiatives
- Ability to balance personal and collective interests
- Growing capacity to inspire and mobilize others
- Development of increasingly sophisticated social understanding
- Integration of individual purpose with collective benefit

[Functional Description]
Public spirit develops through expanding circles of awareness and engagement. Beginning with recognition of immediate community connections, it grows through direct experience of collective achievement and shared challenge. As understanding deepens, individuals naturally discover how their unique capabilities can serve collective needs, leading to increasingly skilled and nuanced forms of contribution.

This quality operates as a dynamic bridge between personal and collective development. Through its expression, individual growth naturally enriches community life, while participation in collective achievement feeds back into personal development. This creates an upward spiral where personal excellence and social contribution become increasingly integrated, enabling both individual fulfillment and social progress.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the utilitarian emphasis on collective welfare while making it experientially accessible
2. Maintains sophistication while using phenomenological language
3. Connects individual development to collective benefit
4. Provides clear markers for development and manifestation
5. Makes the quality observable and cultivatable
6. Maintains cross-cultural relevance
7. Keeps practical applicability central

The description passes the verification questions by:
- Using universal human experiences of community and contribution
- Maintaining the philosophical depth of collective welfare optimization
- Providing clear practical manifestations
- Linking personal and universal aspects
- Outlining development pathway
- Offering observable markers

Would you like me to adjust any aspect to better meet the objectives?
