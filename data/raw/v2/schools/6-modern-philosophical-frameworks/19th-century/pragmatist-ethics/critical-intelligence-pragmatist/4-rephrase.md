Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS for Critical Intelligence:
- Core phenomenon: Integration of thinking and experience in problem-solving
- Key functions: Analysis, synthesis, practical judgment, learning from consequences
- Systemic role: Enables adaptive response and intelligent action
- Developmental aspect: Grows through practice and reflection on experience

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
- Universal experiences: Problem-solving, learning from experience, making sense of situations
- Parallel concepts: Practical wisdom, discernment, intelligent judgment
- Contemporary relevance: Complex decision-making, navigating uncertainty, continuous learning
- Timeless patterns: Observation-reflection-action cycle, experiential learning

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to engage skillfully with experience through careful observation, reflective understanding, and intelligent action. It combines sharp discernment with practical judgment, enabling one to learn from consequences and adapt responses to changing situations while maintaining systematic awareness of broader patterns and implications.

[Essential Nature]
Critical intelligence represents the mind's natural capacity to learn from experience refined through conscious development. It operates as an integrated cycle of attention, reflection, and action, where each experience becomes material for deeper understanding. Unlike purely analytical thinking, it remains grounded in practical consequences while maintaining systematic awareness. It combines the immediacy of direct perception with the depth of reflective understanding, enabling both quick situational responses and long-term pattern recognition.

[Manifestations]
- Sharp observation that notices relevant details and meaningful patterns
- Flexible thinking that adapts to changing circumstances while maintaining coherence
- Practical judgment that balances multiple factors in decision-making
- Systematic reflection that extracts learning from experience
- Integration of past learning with present challenges
- Balanced consideration of immediate and longer-term consequences
- Active experimentation combined with careful observation of results

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through an ongoing dialogue between experience and reflection. When faced with a situation, it enables one to quickly notice relevant patterns while maintaining enough detachment to analyze systematically. It combines immediate intuitive understanding with careful consideration, leading to actions that are both timely and well-considered. The mind becomes increasingly refined in its capacity to learn from consequences, building a practical wisdom that improves over time.

In daily life, this manifests as the ability to navigate complex situations with both immediacy and depth. Rather than being overwhelmed by complexity or rushing to premature conclusions, one maintains a balanced engagement that enables effective action while continuing to learn and adjust. This creates an upward spiral where each experience contributes to growing capability, leading to increasingly sophisticated understanding and more effective action.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: ✓ (focuses on universal human capacities)
2. Depth preservation: ✓ (maintains sophistication while using accessible language)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear connection to everyday experience)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (links personal development to universal patterns)
5. Development clarity: ✓ (shows how capacity grows through experience)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (concrete, verifiable expressions)

The description aims to capture the pragmatist emphasis on intelligent inquiry while expressing it in terms of universal human experience and development. It maintains philosophical sophistication while remaining accessible and practical.
