CORE PRINCIPLES OF PRAGMATIST ETHICS:\n- Focus on practical consequences\n- Emphasis on growth and development\n- Integration of individual and social\n- Experimental method in ethics\n- Democratic commitment\n- Education as key to moral development\n\n2.

SYNTHESIS APPROACH:\nThe list should:\n- Cover the main domains of pragmatist thought\n- Show interconnections between virtues\n- Reflect both personal and social transformation\n- Enable practical application\n- Support democratic life\n- Foster continuous development\n\nBased on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of most representative pragmatist virtues:\n\nCORE PRAGMATIST VIRTUES:\n\n1. CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE\n- The capacity for reflective problem-solving\n- Integration of thinking and experience\n- Foundation for other virtues\n\n2. EXPERIMENTAL DISPOSITION\n- Willingness to test ideas in practice\n- Openness to revision\n- Anti-dogmatic attitude\n\n3. SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE\n- Understanding of social contexts\n- Capacity for cooperative inquiry\n- Democratic sensibility\n\n4. MELIORISTIC COURAGE\n- Commitment to possibility of improvement\n- Moral courage in face of uncertainty\n- Active hope\n\n5. DEMOCRATIC FAITH\n- Trust in collaborative problem-solving\n- Commitment to inclusive dialogue\n- Public-mindedness\n\n6. GROWTH-MINDEDNESS\n- Orientation toward development\n- Capacity for self-correction\n- Learning from experience\n\n7.

Structure:\n- Start with clearest, most fundamental aspect\n- Build complexity progressively\n- Connect abstract principles to concrete manifestations\n- Link individual to universal aspects\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```markdown\n[Core Definition]\nSingle paragraph capturing fundamental essence\n(50-75 words)\n\n[Essential Nature]\nDeeper elaboration of the quality's nature and function\n(100-150 words)\n\n[Manifestations]\n- Observable expressions (4-7 bullet points)\n- Developmental aspects\n- Practical implementations\n- Relationship patterns\n\n[Functional Description]\nHow this quality operates and develops in human experience\nTwo paragraphs:\n1. Operation/mechanism (75-100 words)\n2. Practical expression/impact (75-100 words)\n```\n\nQUALITY CRITERIA:\n1. Comprehensiveness:\n- Captures full depth of original concept\n- Addresses multiple dimensions (personal/interpersonal/universal)\n- Includes both theoretical and practical aspects\n\n2. Accessibility:\n- Understandable without specialized knowledge\n- Relatable to common experience\n- Practical and applicable\n\n3. Precision:\n- Clear differentiation from related concepts\n- Specific rather than vague descriptions\n- Accurate to original meaning\n\n4. Relevance:\n- Contemporary applications clear\n- Universal human significance evident\n- Practical value apparent\n\nVERIFICATION QUESTIONS:\n1. Would this description be meaningful across cultures?\n2. Does it preserve the depth of the original concept?\n3. Is it practically applicable?\n4. Does it connect individual to universal aspects?\n5. Is it clear how this quality develops?\n6. Are the manifestations observable/verifiable?\n\nUPDATED SCOPE: Please focus on the following virtue: Critical Intelligence. Follow the provided preparation instructions, composition guidelines, and output format to create a universal language description of the virtue."
