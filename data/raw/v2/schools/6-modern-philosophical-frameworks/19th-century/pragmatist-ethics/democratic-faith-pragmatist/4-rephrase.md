Let me follow the process systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Collective human capacity for intelligent cooperation
Key functions: 
- Enables sustained collaborative problem-solving
- Builds social trust and cooperation
- Supports inclusive decision-making
- Maintains social hope during challenges

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Group problem-solving
- Community cooperation
- Collective wisdom emergence
- Shared decision-making
- Social trust building

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Trust in collective intelligence
- Active participation disposition
- Inclusive collaboration capacity
- Social problem-solving orientation

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The sustained conviction in humanity's collective capacity to solve shared problems through inclusive cooperation, combined with the active disposition to participate in collaborative sense-making and decision-making processes. This quality integrates social trust with practical engagement in collective problem-solving.

[Essential Nature]
At its core, this quality represents a dynamic integration of trust and action regarding human collective capability. It manifests as both an internal orientation of confidence in shared intelligence and an external commitment to participatory problem-solving. Unlike blind optimism, it is grounded in practical experience of successful collective action and understanding of human collaborative potential.

This quality emerges from recognizing that complex challenges require multiple perspectives and cooperative effort, combined with direct experience of collective wisdom emerging through inclusive dialogue and collaborative action. It sustains engagement in shared challenges despite setbacks, anchored in practical understanding of how human groups can successfully self-organize and solve problems.

[Manifestations]
- Sustained engagement in collective problem-solving despite temporary failures
- Active contribution to group decision-making processes
- Openness to diverse perspectives and inclusive dialogue
- Investment in building and maintaining collaborative relationships
- Practical support for collective learning and development
- Balance of patience with urgent action in group processes
- Recognition and nurturing of emerging collective wisdom

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dual process of internal conviction and external engagement. The internal aspect maintains confidence in collective capability through understanding patterns of successful cooperation and recognizing emergence of group intelligence. The external aspect drives active participation in collaborative processes, contributing to and learning from collective experience. These reinforce each other as practical engagement validates and deepens the core conviction.

In practice, this quality enables sustained participation in long-term collective challenges by providing both motivation and practical wisdom for effective cooperation. It helps navigate the tension between individual and collective needs, supports resilience during setbacks, and guides development of collaborative skills. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where successful cooperation strengthens faith in collective capability, encouraging further engagement and skill development.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the pragmatist emphasis on practical action and consequences
2. Translates democratic specifics into universal collaborative dynamics
3. Maintains connection between belief and practice
4. Emphasizes developmental and experiential aspects
5. Links individual and collective dimensions
6. Provides clear behavioral manifestations
7. Explains functional mechanisms
8. Maintains philosophical sophistication while using accessible language

The description should be meaningful across cultures as it focuses on universal experiences of collective problem-solving and cooperation. It preserves the depth of pragmatist insights while making them accessible through experiential language and practical examples.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
