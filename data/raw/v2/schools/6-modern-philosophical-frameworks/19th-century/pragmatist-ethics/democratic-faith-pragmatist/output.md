[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dual process of internal conviction and external engagement. The internal aspect maintains confidence in collective capability through understanding patterns of successful cooperation and recognizing emergence of group intelligence. The external aspect drives active participation in collaborative processes, contributing to and learning from collective experience. These reinforce each other as practical engagement validates and deepens the core conviction.

In practice, this quality enables sustained participation in long-term collective challenges by providing both motivation and practical wisdom for effective cooperation. It helps navigate the tension between individual and collective needs, supports resilience during setbacks, and guides development of collaborative skills. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where successful cooperation strengthens faith in collective capability, encouraging further engagement and skill development.
