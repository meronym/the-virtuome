[Core Definition]
The capacity for expansive love that naturally flows outward, manifesting as active care and profound recognition of interconnectedness. This quality begins with personal bonds but naturally extends to encompass wider circles of life, expressing itself through practical acts of care, protection, and nurturing support.

[Essential Nature]
Represents the fundamental force of connection and care that transcends mere emotional affection, operating as an active principle of engagement with life. It combines deep recognition of shared existence with practical expression through supportive action. Unlike simple empathy or compassion, it carries an element of responsibility and commitment, manifesting as sustained care that extends beyond immediate circumstances or personal benefit.

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive expansion of authentic care, starting from close personal bonds and naturally extending outward. It operates by dissolving the perceived barriers between self and other, creating an experiential recognition of shared existence that automatically generates appropriate caring responses. The development process involves both heart and hands - combining emotional expansion with practical skill in expressing care effectively.

In daily life, it manifests as a natural orientation toward supporting and nurturing life in all its forms. This creates a characteristic pattern of behavior marked by generous care, protective action, and practical support, while maintaining wisdom about boundaries and appropriate expression. The quality becomes self-reinforcing, as acts of care strengthen the sense of connection, which in turn deepens the capacity for care.
