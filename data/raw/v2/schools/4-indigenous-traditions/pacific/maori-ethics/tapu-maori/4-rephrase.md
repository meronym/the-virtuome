Let me walk through this systematically:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of TAPU:
1. Core principle: Sacred boundaries and inherent dignity
2. Key functions: 
   - Protects what is precious/vital
   - Establishes respectful relationships
   - Maintains natural/social order
   - Guides behavior through recognition of sacred dimension
3. Systemic role:
   - Interacts with mana (power/authority)
   - Structures relationships with environment
   - Orders social interactions
   - Preserves vital resources/knowledge

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Common human experiences:
- Recognition of sacred/special
- Need for protective boundaries
- Sense of inherent dignity
- Reverence for life/nature
- Recognition of things "set apart"

Parallel concepts:
- Sacred/holy (religious traditions)
- Dignity (human rights)
- Reverence (philosophical)
- Boundaries (psychological)
- Respect (ethical)

Here's my attempted universal translation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The recognition and protection of inherent dignity and sacred worth in beings, places, and principles through mindful boundaries and reverent attention. This quality establishes right relationship with what is precious and vital, guiding behavior through deep respect rather than mere rules.

[Essential Nature]
Sacred boundary-keeping arises from direct recognition of inherent dignity and vital essence in life's manifestations. It operates through heightened awareness that certain aspects of existence require special care and consideration. This quality creates protective spaces around what is precious while maintaining dynamic relationship with it.

This recognition naturally generates appropriate boundaries, not through external rules but through inner acknowledgment of sacred worth. It manifests as careful attention, measured approach, and protective respect that preserves rather than possesses what is precious.

[Manifestations]
- Careful, mindful approach to significant places, beings, or moments
- Natural establishment of appropriate boundaries around what is precious
- Deep respect that protects without disconnecting
- Recognition and preservation of inherent dignity in self and others
- Reverent attention that enhances rather than diminishes vital essence
- Protective stewardship of resources, knowledge, and relationships
- Creation of safe spaces for vulnerable or sacred aspects of life

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through heightened awareness of inherent worth and vital essence, generating natural boundaries that protect without isolating. It develops through direct recognition of what is precious and sacred, maturing from external observance of restrictions into internal recognition of appropriate relationship. This recognition produces spontaneous care and measured approach to what holds special significance.

In practice, it manifests as careful stewardship of resources, protective boundaries around vulnerable spaces or beings, and maintenance of appropriate distance or protocol where needed. Rather than rigid rules, it fosters dynamic, responsible relationship with what is precious, ensuring preservation while allowing appropriate access and use. This creates sustainable relationships with resources, knowledge, and power while maintaining their essential integrity.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? Yes - connects to universal human recognition of sacred/special
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophistication while expanding accessibility
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear manifestations and functional description
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal recognition to universal principles
5. Development clear? Yes - shows progression from external to internal recognition
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - concrete behaviors and patterns listed

The translation maintains the sophisticated understanding of tapu while making it accessible to those without MƒÅori cultural context. It preserves the dynamic relationship between restriction and protection while connecting to universal human experiences of recognizing and protecting what is precious.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this translation?
