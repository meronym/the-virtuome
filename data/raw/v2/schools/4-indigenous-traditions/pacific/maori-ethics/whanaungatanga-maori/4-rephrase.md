Systemic Roles:
- Foundation for social resilience
- Framework for mutual aid
- Structure for collective decision-making
- Basis for identity formation

Developmental Aspects:

UNIVERSALIZATION:

Here's my attempt at a universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The conscious cultivation and maintenance of life-sustaining relationships, expressing the fundamental human capacity to recognize, build, and strengthen connections across multiple dimensions of existence. It manifests as an active awareness of interdependence and the purposeful development of supportive networks that enhance both individual and collective wellbeing.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the human capacity to perceive, nurture, and expand meaningful connections that form the fabric of social existence. It goes beyond simple social interaction to encompass a deep understanding of interdependence and mutual responsibility. At its core, it expresses the recognition that human flourishing occurs through the conscious cultivation of supportive relationships and the acknowledgment that individual identity emerges through our connections to others, past, present, and future.

[Manifestations]
- Active participation in building and maintaining support networks
- Regular engagement in activities that strengthen collective bonds
- Conscious acknowledgment and honoring of relationships
- Practical expressions of mutual care and responsibility
- Development of skills in relationship cultivation and maintenance
- Recognition and fulfillment of obligations to various relationship circles
- Creation of opportunities for meaningful connection

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through heightened awareness of relational dynamics and active engagement in relationship-building practices. It develops through progressive expansion of one's circle of conscious connections, starting with immediate family and extending to broader community and environmental relationships. The capacity grows through practical experience in maintaining relationships and understanding their interconnected nature.

In practice, it manifests as consistent attention to relationship maintenance, regular participation in collective activities, and conscious development of support networks. It leads to increased social resilience, enhanced problem-solving capabilities through collective resources, and deeper sense of belonging and purpose. The quality transforms both individual and community through the creation of strong, interconnected support systems that enable collective flourishing.
