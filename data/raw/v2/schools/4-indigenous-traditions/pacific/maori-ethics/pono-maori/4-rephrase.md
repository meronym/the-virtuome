Let me work through this systematically for Pono:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
- Core: Truth/authenticity as active principle
- Functions: Maintains social trust, guides behavior, ensures integrity
- Systemic role: Foundation for relationships and leadership
- Development: From external truthfulness to internal authenticity

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
- Universal experiences: Truth-seeking, authenticity, integrity
- Cross-cultural parallels: Veracity (Roman), Satya (Indian), Xin (Chinese)
- Contemporary relevance: Personal authenticity, organizational integrity
- Timeless patterns: Truth-action alignment, genuine self-expression

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The active alignment of inner truth with outer expression, manifesting as unwavering integrity in thought, word, and action. This quality represents the conscious cultivation of authenticity and the consistent choice to embody genuine truth in all dimensions of life.

[Essential Nature]
Truth-embodiment operates as a dynamic force that harmonizes internal understanding with external expression. Unlike passive honesty, it represents an active principle of alignment that permeates all aspects of being and doing. This quality functions as both a compass and a catalyst - guiding authentic action while transforming the actor through its expression.

This fundamental coherence between inner reality and outer manifestation creates a foundation for genuine relationship, effective leadership, and meaningful contribution. It develops through progressive refinement of perception, continuous choice for authenticity, and deepening alignment between understanding and action.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent alignment between speech and action
- Natural authority that emerges from authentic self-expression
- Transparent and trustworthy relationships
- Clear and direct communication without hidden agendas
- Genuine presence that invites truth from others
- Decisions and actions that reflect deep principles rather than superficial concerns

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through an iterative process of aligning understanding with expression. Beginning with basic truthfulness in speech, it progressively deepens into all dimensions of life - thoughts, emotions, relationships, and actions. Each choice for truth strengthens the capacity for greater authenticity, while each authentic expression creates conditions for deeper truth-realization.

In practical application, this quality transforms relationships by creating foundations of genuine trust, enhances leadership through authentic presence, and enables effective collaboration through transparent communication. It manifests as natural authority rather than imposed power, inviting others into greater authenticity through its expression. The result is an environment of mutual trust and genuine connection that enables both individual growth and collective achievement.

Verification Review:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? ✓ Uses universal human experiences
2. Preserves depth? ✓ Maintains sophistication while increasing accessibility
3. Practical applicability? ✓ Clear manifestations and development path
4. Individual-universal connection? ✓ Links personal practice to collective impact
5. Development clarity? ✓ Shows progression from basic to advanced
6. Observable manifestations? ✓ Concrete, verifiable expressions

The description maintains the essence of Pono while making it accessible and applicable across cultural contexts. It preserves the depth and active nature of the original concept while expressing it in universal terms that connect to common human experience.

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
