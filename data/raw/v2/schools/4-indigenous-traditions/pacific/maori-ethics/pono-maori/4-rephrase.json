      "content": "Let me think through this carefully:\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n\n1. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n- M\u0101ori ethics are holistic and interconnected\n- Many concepts overlap or contain aspects of others\n- Some virtues are more foundational, while others are derivative\n\n2. SELECTION CRITERIA:\n- Foundational importance to the tradition\n- Distinctiveness of the concept\n- Breadth of application\n- Frequency in traditional teachings\n- Contemporary relevance\n- Role in character development\n\n3. KEY OBSERVATIONS:\n- Mana and tapu are fundamental organizing principles\n- Relationships (with people, nature, ancestors) are central\n- Individual virtues are always understood in collective context\n- Environmental stewardship is inseparable from personal ethics\n- Spiritual and practical dimensions are integrated\n\n4. SYNTHESIS APPROACH:\n- Include core metaphysical concepts that ground the ethics\n- Represent both individual and collective dimensions\n- Cover spiritual, social, and practical domains\n- Ensure the selected virtues work together as a system\n- Focus on transformative rather than merely descriptive concepts\n\nBased on this analysis, here's my proposed shortlist of core M\u0101ori virtues:\n\n1. MANA\n- Foundational concept of power, prestige, and honor\n- Both personal and collective\n- Guides development of character and leadership\n\n2. WHANAUNGATANGA\n- Relationship-building and maintenance\n- Foundation of social ethics\n- Extends beyond human relationships to nature and ancestors\n\n3. KAITIAKITANGA\n- Guardianship/stewardship\n- Environmental and cultural responsibility\n- Active expression of relationship with nature\n\n4. MANAAKITANGA\n- Hospitality and care for others\n- Practical expression of aroha (love)\n- Central to social harmony\n\n5. TAPU\n- Sacred restrictions and spiritual wisdom\n- Guides behavior and respect\n- Maintains social and spiritual order\n\n6. AROHA\n- Love, compassion, empathy\n- Motivating force for ethical behavior\n- Connects individual to collective wellbeing\n\n7. TIKA\n- Righteousness and correct action\n- Practical wisdom in applying principles\n- Guide for decision-making\n\n8. PONO\n- Truth, integrity, authenticity\n- Personal and interpersonal honesty\n- Foundation for trust\n\nThese eight virtues form a coherent system where:\n- Mana and tapu provide the metaphysical foundation\n- Whanaungatanga and aroha establish relational orientation\n- Kaitiakitanga and manaakitanga guide practical action\n- Tika and pono ensure proper implementation\n\nEach virtue:\n- Has both personal and collective dimensions\n- Connects to spiritual and practical realms\n- Contributes to character development\n- Remains relevant in contemporary contexts\n- Works in harmony with the others\n\nThis selection provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and developing virtue while maintaining the distinctive characteristics of M\u0101ori ethical thought.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these core virtues?"

Structure:\n- Start with clearest, most fundamental aspect\n- Build complexity progressively\n- Connect abstract principles to concrete manifestations\n- Link individual to universal aspects\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```markdown\n[Core Definition]\nSingle paragraph capturing fundamental essence\n(50-75 words)\n\n[Essential Nature]\nDeeper elaboration of the quality's nature and function\n(100-150 words)\n\n[Manifestations]\n- Observable expressions (4-7 bullet points)\n- Developmental aspects\n- Practical implementations\n- Relationship patterns\n\n[Functional Description]\nHow this quality operates and develops in human experience\nTwo paragraphs:\n1. Operation/mechanism (75-100 words)\n2. Practical expression/impact (75-100 words)\n```\n\nQUALITY CRITERIA:\n1. Comprehensiveness:\n- Captures full depth of original concept\n- Addresses multiple dimensions (personal/interpersonal/universal)\n- Includes both theoretical and practical aspects\n\n2. Accessibility:\n- Understandable without specialized knowledge\n- Relatable to common experience\n- Practical and applicable\n\n3. Precision:\n- Clear differentiation from related concepts\n- Specific rather than vague descriptions\n- Accurate to original meaning\n\n4. Relevance:\n- Contemporary applications clear\n- Universal human significance evident\n- Practical value apparent\n\nVERIFICATION QUESTIONS:\n1. Would this description be meaningful across cultures?\n2. Does it preserve the depth of the original concept?\n3. Is it practically applicable?\n4. Does it connect individual to universal aspects?\n5. Is it clear how this quality develops?\n6. Are the manifestations observable/verifiable?\n\nUPDATED SCOPE: Please focus on the following virtue: Pono. Follow the provided preparation instructions, composition guidelines, and output format to create a universal language description of the virtue."
