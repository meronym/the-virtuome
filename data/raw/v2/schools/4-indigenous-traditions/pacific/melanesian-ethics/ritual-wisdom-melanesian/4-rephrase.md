Let me analyze and transform the Melanesian concept of Ritual Wisdom into universal language.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Integration of knowledge, action, and meaning in significant moments
Key functions: 
- Creates meaningful transitions
- Maintains social-spiritual coherence
- Transmits deep understanding through practice
- Structures transformative experiences

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Life transitions
- Meaningful ceremonies
- Sacred moments
- Transformative practices
- Deep understanding through action

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Ceremonial intelligence: the capacity to understand, create, and navigate meaningful transitions and transformative moments through intentional action and precise awareness. This quality combines deep understanding with practical skill in crafting and conducting experiences that connect individual meaning to universal patterns.

[Essential Nature]
Ceremonial intelligence operates at the intersection of knowledge, action, and meaning. It represents the human capacity to create and maintain significant moments that transform experience from mundane to meaningful through precise attention and intentional practice. This quality enables the translation of deep understanding into structured experience, creating bridges between individual consciousness and universal patterns.

Unlike abstract knowledge, ceremonial intelligence manifests through the body and community, expressing wisdom through action rather than concept alone. It develops through practice, observation, and progressive refinement of awareness, particularly in moments of transition or significance.

[Manifestations]
- Precise attention to timing, sequence, and detail in significant moments
- Ability to create and maintain focused, transformative atmospheres
- Skill in guiding individual and collective transitions
- Integration of meaning through symbolic action and gesture
- Recognition and appropriate response to the quality of moments
- Capacity to structure experience for maximum significance
- Balance of form and spontaneity in meaningful activities

[Functional Description]
Ceremonial intelligence develops through progressive refinement of attention and action, particularly in contexts of significance. Beginning with basic pattern recognition and mimicry, it evolves through understanding of underlying principles to eventual mastery where form and essence become unified. This development requires both practical experience and deepening insight into the relationship between action, meaning, and transformation.

In practice, this quality enables individuals to create and maintain experiences that connect personal meaning to universal patterns. It manifests in the ability to recognize what makes moments significant, to structure activities for maximum impact, and to guide both individual and collective transitions with precision and depth. This intelligence serves as a bridge between abstract understanding and lived experience, allowing wisdom to be embodied rather than merely understood.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: ✓ (focuses on universal human experience of significant moments)
2. Depth preservation: ✓ (maintains sophisticated understanding while removing culture-specific elements)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear connections to observable behaviors and development)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (links personal capacity to universal patterns)
5. Developmental clarity: ✓ (progression from basic to advanced understanding described)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (concrete, verifiable expressions listed)

The description maintains the sophistication of the original Melanesian concept while making it accessible and relevant across cultural contexts. It preserves the essential relationship between knowledge, action, and meaning while expressing it in universal terms.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
