Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Intergenerational harmony and knowledge transmission
Functions: Social continuity, wisdom preservation, identity maintenance
Systemic role: Cultural perpetuation, social stability
Developmental aspects: Progressive assumption of responsibilities

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Learning from elders
- Teaching younger generations
- Cultural transmission
- Life cycle transitions
- Identity formation
- Legacy creation

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS:
Primary:
- Bidirectional care and respect
- Knowledge stewardship
- Identity maintenance
- Social continuity

Secondary:
- Generation gaps
- Cultural erosion
- Social fragmentation
- Modernization pressures

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain, nurture, and strengthen the living bridge between generations through conscious stewardship of knowledge, wisdom, and identity. This involves both honoring the legacy of previous generations and actively cultivating the potential of future ones, ensuring cultural and social continuity while adapting to change.

[Essential Nature]
Generational responsibility manifests as an active awareness of one's place within the continuous flow of human experience and knowledge across time. It encompasses both the receptive virtue of learning from and honoring those who came before, and the generative virtue of nurturing and preparing those who will follow. This quality enables individuals to serve as living connections between past and future, maintaining the integrity of cultural transmission while allowing for necessary evolution and adaptation.

At its core, this virtue represents the conscious participation in humanity's intergenerational dialogue, where each generation simultaneously acts as student, practitioner, and teacher of accumulated wisdom and emerging knowledge.

[Manifestations]
- Demonstrated respect and care for elders, expressed through attention, support, and integration of their wisdom
- Active mentorship and nurturing of younger generations through teaching, guidance, and example
- Preservation and thoughtful adaptation of cultural knowledge and practices
- Balanced decision-making that considers impacts on future generations
- Cultivation of intergenerational dialogue and understanding
- Creation of opportunities for meaningful connection between age groups
- Stewardship of resources and traditions for future benefit

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay of receptivity and responsibility, where individuals develop from being primarily receivers of generational wisdom to becoming active stewards and transmitters of cultural knowledge. This development progresses through stages of learning, integration, practice, and teaching, with each stage building upon and incorporating the previous ones. The mature expression involves simultaneous engagement with past, present, and future generations.

In practice, generational responsibility manifests as concrete actions that strengthen intergenerational bonds and ensure cultural continuity. This includes creating opportunities for elders to share their wisdom, facilitating youth engagement with traditional knowledge, maintaining intergenerational dialogue, and adapting cultural practices to remain relevant while preserving their essential meaning. It requires both respect for tradition and openness to evolution, ensuring cultural vitality across time.
```

I believe this universalization:
1. Preserves the core meaning while making it accessible
2. Maintains practical relevance across cultures
3. Captures both individual and collective dimensions
4. Provides clear developmental framework
5. Offers observable manifestations
6. Connects to universal human experience

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
