Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Mutual flow of resources/support through social networks
Functions: 
- Resource distribution
- Social bond strengthening
- Security network maintenance
- Community resilience building
Key patterns:
- Giving triggers receiving
- Individual acts serve collective wellbeing
- Material exchanges carry social meaning
- Delayed reciprocity builds trust

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Gift-giving/receiving
- Support network participation
- Resource sharing
- Community interdependence
Contemporary relevance:
- Social capital building
- Sustainable economics
- Community resilience
- Network-based support systems

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to participate fully in the natural flow of giving and receiving that sustains human communities, characterized by an intuitive awareness of when and how to share resources, support others, and accept help in ways that strengthen the entire social fabric.

[Essential Nature]
Reciprocal generosity manifests as an embodied understanding that human flourishing depends on continuous cycles of giving and receiving. It transcends simple transaction, operating instead as an organic process of resource circulation that builds lasting bonds and creates resilient support networks. This quality combines material practicality with social intelligence, recognizing that the true value of sharing lies not just in what is exchanged, but in the relationships and trust it cultivates.

[Manifestations]
- Natural impulse to share resources when abundance is present
- Graceful acceptance of support when needed
- Intuitive awareness of timing in giving and receiving
- Ability to maintain multiple ongoing cycles of exchange
- Recognition of non-material forms of contribution
- Development of ever-widening circles of mutual support
- Creation of resilient community safety nets through consistent participation

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive recognition of interdependence and repeated participation in successful exchanges. Initially emerging as simple give-and-take, it matures into sophisticated social intelligence that can navigate complex networks of obligation and opportunity. The practitioner learns to read subtle social cues, understand timing, and maintain multiple reciprocal relationships simultaneously.

In practice, reciprocal generosity creates resilient communities by establishing robust networks of mutual support. It transforms material exchanges into social bonds, converting temporary transactions into lasting relationships. This creates a self-reinforcing system where individual acts of sharing strengthen collective security, while community resilience supports individual wellbeing.

This universalization maintains the core insights of Melanesian wantok systems while making them accessible to other cultural contexts. It preserves:
- The systemic nature of giving/receiving
- The link between material and social aspects
- The emphasis on relationship building
- The security/resilience functions

While adding:
- Contemporary applications
- Universal psychological principles
- Developmental framework
- Practical indicators

The description connects individual actions to collective outcomes while remaining culturally neutral and practically applicable across contexts.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
