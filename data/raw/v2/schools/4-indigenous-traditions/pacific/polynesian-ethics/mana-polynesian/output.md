[Core Definition]
The inherent power and authority that emerges from the alignment of capability with responsibility, manifesting as both personal force and social influence, and growing through right action and faithful stewardship of resources, relationships, and responsibilities.

[Essential Nature]
A dynamic form of authentic power that exists at the intersection of personal capacity and social responsibility. Unlike mere institutional authority or raw force, it represents the natural authority that emerges when capability meets character, growing stronger through ethical action and diminishing through misuse. It manifests as a tangible presence or force that others can perceive, combining earned respect with inherited dignity, and demanding responsible stewardship of whatever falls within one's sphere of influence.

[Manifestations]
- Natural authority that others recognize without formal declaration
- Deep sense of responsibility proportional to one's capabilities
- Presence that influences without demanding or compelling
- Capacity that grows through ethical action and proper stewardship
- Power that serves rather than dominates
- Authority that comes from alignment with natural and social orders
- Influence that builds rather than diminishes others

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through the dynamic interaction between personal development and social responsibility. As one's capabilities grow, so does the scope of responsibility; as responsibilities are met with integrity, personal authority naturally increases. It creates a self-reinforcing cycle where proper use of influence leads to greater capacity, while misuse diminishes both authority and effectiveness. The power involved is generative rather than coercive, building up rather than controlling others.

In practice, it manifests as a form of natural leadership that others willingly follow, combined with a deep sense of obligation to use one's capabilities for the greater good. Those embodying this quality find themselves naturally trusted with increasing responsibility, not through seeking power but through demonstrating wisdom in its use. It creates a sustainable form of influence based on earned trust and demonstrated character rather than position or force.
