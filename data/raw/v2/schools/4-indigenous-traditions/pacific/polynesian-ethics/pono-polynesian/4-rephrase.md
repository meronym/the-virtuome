Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of PONO:
Core principle: Dynamic equilibrium between right action and cosmic order
Key functions: 
- Maintains harmony across dimensions
- Guides ethical decision-making
- Balances competing needs/forces
- Aligns individual with universal order

Universal experiences it relates to:
- Seeking wholeness/completion
- Balancing competing demands
- Aligning actions with deeper principles
- Finding right relationship with self/others/world

Here's my attempt at the universal language transformation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to perceive, maintain, and restore right relationship between all elements of life - self, others, nature, and principles. It manifests as an active equilibrium that harmonizes competing forces while advancing the welfare of the whole system.

[Essential Nature]
This quality operates as both an inner compass and an active force for alignment and integration. It combines acute perception of what is needed in any situation with the wisdom to respond appropriately. Unlike rigid righteousness or passive harmony, it represents dynamic equilibrium - continuously sensing, adjusting, and realigning to maintain optimal relationship between all factors.

At its core, it embodies the recognition that everything exists in relationship, and that the health of any system depends on the right relationship between its parts. This understanding manifests as both deep wisdom and practical skill in maintaining beneficial balance.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent alignment between principles and actions
- Skillful balancing of competing needs and interests
- Natural authority that comes from embodied integrity
- Capacity to restore harmony in disturbed systems
- Recognition and maintenance of appropriate boundaries
- Ability to discern and implement what is truly needed
- Integration of personal conduct with universal principles

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of perception, judgment, and response. It begins with basic recognition of harmony versus discord, evolves through understanding of systemic relationships, and matures into intuitive wisdom about maintaining beneficial balance. The process involves increasingly subtle attunement to the nature of right relationship in all dimensions of life.

In practice, it manifests as a combination of clear seeing and skillful action. Those embodying this quality naturally perceive what is needed to maintain or restore harmony in any situation. Their actions carry authority not through force but through alignment with deeper principles of balance and relationship. This creates lasting positive impact by addressing root causes rather than symptoms.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? 
Yes - focuses on universal human experience of seeking/maintaining right relationship

2. Preserves depth? 
Yes - retains sophisticated understanding of dynamic equilibrium and systemic relationships

3. Practically applicable? 
Yes - describes observable manifestations and development path

4. Individual-universal connection? 
Yes - links personal conduct to universal principles

5. Development clarity? 
Yes - describes progression from basic recognition to mature wisdom

6. Observable manifestations? 
Yes - lists concrete expressions that can be recognized and verified

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this transformation?
