      "content": "Let me think through this systematically.\n\nANALYTICAL APPROACH:\nTo identify the most representative virtues, I'll consider:\n\n1. FOUNDATIONAL CRITERIA:\n- Frequency of appearance across different Polynesian cultures\n- Centrality to worldview and social organization\n- Depth of influence on other virtues\n- Practical impact on daily life and social relations\n\n2. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Need to capture both individual and collective dimensions\n- Balance between spiritual and practical aspects\n- Coverage of human-nature-spirit relationships\n- Representation of both active and contemplative virtues\n\n3. ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES:\nThe Polynesian worldview is fundamentally:\n- Relational (everything is connected)\n- Holistic (spiritual-physical unity)\n- Hierarchical (respecting proper order)\n- Ecological (embedded in nature)\n- Genealogical (ancestral connections)\n\n4. KEY INSIGHTS:\n- The most fundamental virtues tend to be those that maintain harmony across multiple dimensions (personal, social, environmental, spiritual)\n- Core virtues often appear as both personal qualities and collective responsibilities\n- The most essential virtues typically connect daily practice with deeper spiritual principles\n\nBased on this analysis, I propose this shortlist of core representative virtues:\n\n1. MANA\n- Foundational concept of spiritual power/authority\n- Links personal conduct with cosmic order\n- Underlies both rights and responsibilities\n\n2. ALOHA/AROHA\n- Fundamental principle of love/compassion\n- Governs both personal relations and universal connection\n- Integrates emotional and practical care\n\n3. PONO\n- Righteousness/balance/harmony\n- Bridges personal conduct and cosmic order\n- Guides ethical decision-making\n\n4. KULEANA\n- Responsibility/privilege/duty\n- Links rights with obligations\n- Connects individual to community\n\n5. M\u0100LAMA\n- Active care/stewardship\n- Applies to people, land, and traditions\n- Practical expression of deeper values\n\n6. HO'OPONOPONO\n- Restoration of harmony/balance\n- Integrates personal and social healing\n- Practical conflict resolution\n\n7. MAURI\n- Life force/vitality\n- Connects physical and spiritual realms\n- Basis for environmental ethics\n\n8. MANAAKITANGA\n- Generosity/hospitality/care\n- Practical expression of communal values\n- Links individual conduct with collective welfare\n\n9. TAPU/KAPU\n- Sacred restrictions/proper order\n- Maintains spiritual-social boundaries\n- Guidelines for respect and protection\n\nThis selection:\n- Covers individual, social, and environmental dimensions\n- Includes both practical and spiritual aspects\n- Represents both personal qualities and social responsibilities\n- Captures the interconnected nature of Polynesian ethics\n- Provides framework for both personal development and social harmony\n\nEach virtue here serves as a node in an interconnected web of meaning, with practical applications ranging from personal conduct to environmental stewardship to community leadership.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these core virtues?"

Structure:\n- Start with clearest, most fundamental aspect\n- Build complexity progressively\n- Connect abstract principles to concrete manifestations\n- Link individual to universal aspects\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```markdown\n[Core Definition]\nSingle paragraph capturing fundamental essence\n(50-75 words)\n\n[Essential Nature]\nDeeper elaboration of the quality's nature and function\n(100-150 words)\n\n[Manifestations]\n- Observable expressions (4-7 bullet points)\n- Developmental aspects\n- Practical implementations\n- Relationship patterns\n\n[Functional Description]\nHow this quality operates and develops in human experience\nTwo paragraphs:\n1. Operation/mechanism (75-100 words)\n2. Practical expression/impact (75-100 words)\n```\n\nQUALITY CRITERIA:\n1. Comprehensiveness:\n- Captures full depth of original concept\n- Addresses multiple dimensions (personal/interpersonal/universal)\n- Includes both theoretical and practical aspects\n\n2. Accessibility:\n- Understandable without specialized knowledge\n- Relatable to common experience\n- Practical and applicable\n\n3. Precision:\n- Clear differentiation from related concepts\n- Specific rather than vague descriptions\n- Accurate to original meaning\n\n4. Relevance:\n- Contemporary applications clear\n- Universal human significance evident\n- Practical value apparent\n\nVERIFICATION QUESTIONS:\n1. Would this description be meaningful across cultures?\n2. Does it preserve the depth of the original concept?\n3. Is it practically applicable?\n4. Does it connect individual to universal aspects?\n5. Is it clear how this quality develops?\n6. Are the manifestations observable/verifiable?\n\nUPDATED SCOPE: Please focus on the following virtue: Pono. Follow the provided preparation instructions, composition guidelines, and output format to create a universal language description of the virtue."
