Let me break this down systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS (Kuleana):
Core principle: Integration of privilege and responsibility
Key functions:
- Defines reciprocal relationships
- Establishes social-ecological balance
- Creates meaningful purpose
- Structures personal development

Relationship patterns:
- Individual ↔ Community
- Rights ↔ Responsibilities
- Authority ↔ Service
- Privilege ↔ Duty

Developmental aspects:
- Begins with basic role fulfillment
- Expands through increased capability
- Deepens through understanding interconnection
- Matures into conscious stewardship

UNIVERSAL PARALLELS:
- Role responsibility in family/community
- Professional ethics
- Environmental stewardship
- Leadership development
- Social contract theory
- Ecological citizenship

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The integration of privilege and responsibility that emerges from recognizing one's unique position within interconnected systems of life. It manifests as the conscious assumption of duties that arise from one's capabilities, relationships, and received benefits, transforming potential burden into meaningful purpose.

[Essential Nature]
Sacred responsibility represents a fundamental pattern in human experience where capability and duty naturally align, creating purposeful engagement with life. It differs from mere obligation by incorporating deep recognition of privilege - acknowledging that every right carries corresponding responsibilities, and every gift demands stewardship. This quality emerges from understanding one's unique position within networks of relationship and recognizing the natural reciprocity inherent in all sustainable systems.

The mature expression of this quality transforms what might externally appear as burden into internally motivated purpose, as one recognizes that proper response to life's gifts is faithful stewardship of them. This shifts the experience from imposed obligation to conscious participation in life's processes.

[Manifestations]
- Naturally assuming care for areas where one has capability or influence
- Feeling internal motivation to give back in proportion to what has been received
- Finding deeper meaning and purpose through faithful execution of roles
- Experiencing privilege and duty as integrated rather than opposed
- Developing increasing spheres of care alongside growing capability
- Maintaining sustainable reciprocal relationships in all domains
- Demonstrating leadership through service rather than dominance

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive recognition of one's embedded nature within larger systems of life, combined with growing awareness of personal capability and its inherent call to service. It begins with simple role fulfillment but deepens through experience into understanding of natural reciprocity. As capability grows, so does the sphere of responsibility, but this expansion feels natural rather than imposed because it aligns with one's authentic path of development.

In practical expression, this quality manifests as natural assumption of stewardship in areas where one has influence, whether in family, community, profession, or environment. It leads to sustainable relationship patterns where privilege and responsibility remain in balance. Rather than feeling burdened by duties, one experiences them as meaningful expressions of purpose and authentic participation in life's processes. This creates resilient systems where rights and responsibilities remain naturally aligned.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the deep integration of privilege and responsibility central to Kuleana
2. Maintains connection to practical stewardship while broadening context
3. Retains sophisticated understanding of reciprocal relationships
4. Makes concept accessible without cultural-specific knowledge
5. Connects individual development to universal patterns
6. Provides clear framework for practical application
7. Maintains philosophical depth while using experiential language

Would you like me to further refine any aspect of this universalization?
