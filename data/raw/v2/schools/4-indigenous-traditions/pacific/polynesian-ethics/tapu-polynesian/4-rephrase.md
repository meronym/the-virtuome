Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Tapu/Kapu:
Core principle: Sacred boundary-awareness that guides proper relationship with power/potential
Functions: Protection, preservation, respect-cultivation, order-maintenance
Systemic role: Maintains boundaries between sacred/mundane, dangerous/safe, powerful/ordinary
Developmental aspects: From external rule to internalized wisdom

2. UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences: Recognition of power, need for boundaries, respect for profound forces
Parallel concepts: Sacred limits, wise restraint, protective boundaries, power-respect
Contemporary relevance: Environmental protection, personal boundaries, sacred spaces
Timeless patterns: Human relationship with power, necessity of limits, wisdom of restraint

Here's the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, respect, and maintain appropriate boundaries around sources of power, potential, or profound significance. It manifests as an inner sense of sacred limits that protects both the observer and the observed, ensuring proper relationship with forces greater than ourselves.

[Essential Nature]
Sacred boundary-awareness arises from the recognition that certain realities, forces, or potentials require special attention and careful approach. It combines deep respect with practical wisdom, acknowledging that proper boundaries both protect and preserve what is powerful or precious. This quality develops from external observance of rules into an internalized wisdom that naturally perceives appropriate limits and maintains them through conscious choice rather than mere prohibition.

[Manifestations]
- Intuitive recognition of powerful or profound presences requiring special attention
- Natural maintenance of appropriate distance or approach to significant forces/places
- Careful stewardship of resources, relationships, and responsibilities
- Cultivation of proper ceremonial or procedural approaches to important matters
- Protection of sensitive boundaries in self and others
- Development of wisdom regarding timing, preparation, and readiness
- Balance between accessibility and preservation in managing valuable resources

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through heightened awareness of power differentials and significant boundaries, engaging both intuitive recognition and learned wisdom to determine appropriate relationships with forces, spaces, or knowledge of special power or meaning. It develops through progressive refinement of judgment regarding proper approach, handling, and protection of what is significant, moving from rigid rules to fluid wisdom.

In practice, it manifests as natural care in approaching important matters, conscious maintenance of protective boundaries, and wise stewardship of significant resources or relationships. This creates sustainable relationships with powerful forces or precious realities, ensuring their preservation while allowing appropriate access and use. The quality enables both protection and proper engagement, maintaining vital boundaries while allowing necessary flow of power and benefit.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? Yes - speaks to universal human experiences with power and boundaries
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding of power relationships
3. Practical application? Yes - clear guidelines for boundary maintenance and proper approach
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal development to universal principles
5. Development clarity? Yes - shows progression from external rules to internal wisdom
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - concrete behavioral indicators provided

The reformulation maintains the sophisticated power-wisdom of tapu/kapu while making it accessible through universal human experiences with boundaries, power, and respect. It preserves the depth while opening practical application across contexts.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this reformulation?
