      "content": "Let me think through this carefully:\n\nANALYTICAL APPROACH:\n1. Need to identify virtues that are:\n   - Widely shared across different groups\n   - Fundamental rather than derivative\n   - Central to Aboriginal worldview\n   - Clearly focused on human development\n   - Interconnected with core cultural concepts\n\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS:\n1. The Aboriginal worldview is fundamentally relational:\n   - Between people\n   - With country\n   - With ancestors\n   - With spiritual forces\n   - Across time\n\n2. Knowledge and wisdom are:\n   - Layered\n   - Progressive\n   - Context-dependent\n   - Practice-based\n   - Responsibility-linked\n\n3. Core concepts tend to be:\n   - Holistic rather than atomized\n   - Process-oriented rather than static\n   - Relationship-based rather than individualistic\n   - Practical rather than abstract\n   - Experiential rather than theoretical\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA:\n1. Must reflect the interconnected nature of Aboriginal philosophy\n2. Should bridge personal development and communal responsibility\n3. Must acknowledge the spiritual-material unity in Aboriginal thought\n4. Should capture both active and receptive aspects\n5. Must respect the practical wisdom orientation\n\nBased on this analysis, I would propose these as the most representative virtues:\n\n1. DADIRRI (Deep Listening)\n- Encompasses both spiritual and practical attention\n- Fundamental to learning and wisdom\n- Connects individual to community and country\n- Base for developing other virtues\n\n2. KANYINI (Holding/Responsibility)\n- Integrates caring for country, people, and knowledge\n- Represents responsible relationship maintenance\n- Links individual development with collective duty\n- Encompasses stewardship principles\n\n3. RALYA (Right Way Behavior)\n- Proper conduct according to law/lore\n- Encompasses protocol awareness and respect\n- Links personal discipline with cultural maintenance\n- Foundation for social harmony\n\n4. MARRPAN (Strength/Resilience)\n- Both personal and cultural resilience\n- Combines physical, emotional, and spiritual strength\n- Links individual capability with community sustainability\n- Essential for cultural continuation\n\n5. GURRUTU (Proper Relationship)\n- Understanding and maintaining right relationships\n- Encompasses kinship obligations and social harmony\n- Links individual identity with collective belonging\n- Base for social ethics\n\n6. DJAMBATJ (Cleverness/Capability)\n- Practical wisdom and skillful action\n- Combines knowledge with appropriate application\n- Links individual development with community benefit\n- Essential for cultural practice\n\n7. GALKA (Deep Understanding)\n- Wisdom beyond surface knowledge\n- Combines spiritual insight with practical knowledge\n- Links individual learning with cultural transmission\n- Essential for leadership and teaching\n\n8. MUNGGRITJ (Sacred Knowledge Responsibility)\n- Proper handling of cultural knowledge\n- Combines learning with teaching obligations\n- Links personal development with cultural preservation\n- Essential for tradition maintenance\n\nThese eight virtues form an interconnected system that:\n- Covers the main domains of Aboriginal ethical life\n- Represents both personal and collective aspects\n- Includes both active and receptive qualities\n- Maintains the holistic nature of Aboriginal philosophy\n- Acknowledges the practical-spiritual unity\n\nWould you like me to proceed with creating detailed YAML nodes for these virtues?\n\nNote: Some terms used are from specific language groups but represent widely shared concepts. Alternative terms exist in different languages for similar concepts."

Structure:\n- Start with clearest, most fundamental aspect\n- Build complexity progressively\n- Connect abstract principles to concrete manifestations\n- Link individual to universal aspects\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```markdown\n[Core Definition]\nSingle paragraph capturing fundamental essence\n(50-75 words)\n\n[Essential Nature]\nDeeper elaboration of the quality's nature and function\n(100-150 words)\n\n[Manifestations]\n- Observable expressions (4-7 bullet points)\n- Developmental aspects\n- Practical implementations\n- Relationship patterns\n\n[Functional Description]\nHow this quality operates and develops in human experience\nTwo paragraphs:\n1. Operation/mechanism (75-100 words)\n2. Practical expression/impact (75-100 words)\n```\n\nQUALITY CRITERIA:\n1. Comprehensiveness:\n- Captures full depth of original concept\n- Addresses multiple dimensions (personal/interpersonal/universal)\n- Includes both theoretical and practical aspects\n\n2. Accessibility:\n- Understandable without specialized knowledge\n- Relatable to common experience\n- Practical and applicable\n\n3. Precision:\n- Clear differentiation from related concepts\n- Specific rather than vague descriptions\n- Accurate to original meaning\n\n4. Relevance:\n- Contemporary applications clear\n- Universal human significance evident\n- Practical value apparent\n\nVERIFICATION QUESTIONS:\n1. Would this description be meaningful across cultures?\n2. Does it preserve the depth of the original concept?\n3. Is it practically applicable?\n4. Does it connect individual to universal aspects?\n5. Is it clear how this quality develops?\n6. Are the manifestations observable/verifiable?\n\nUPDATED SCOPE: Please focus on the following virtue: Galka. Follow the provided preparation instructions, composition guidelines, and output format to create a universal language description of the virtue."
