Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The integrated capacity to hold responsibility, care, and connection simultaneously across all dimensions of life, expressing itself as an active, unconditional commitment to nurture and sustain the wellbeing of people, places, knowledge, and the wider web of relationships that support life.

[Essential Nature]
Kanyini represents a fundamental way of being in relationship with reality that unifies responsibility and love into a single, seamless response to life. It manifests as a natural impulse to care for and sustain whatever falls within one's sphere of influence, combined with the wisdom to recognize the interconnected nature of all things. This quality transcends ordinary concepts of duty or affection, emerging instead as a holistic engagement with life that recognizes no separation between self-interest and collective wellbeing, between practical action and heart-centered connection, or between responsibility and natural inclination.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous caretaking of people, places, and living systems within one's sphere
- Natural assumption of responsibility without resistance or resentment
- Integrated awareness of the practical and spiritual dimensions of stewardship
- Active maintenance of knowledge and wisdom for future generations
- Consistent expression of care through both daily actions and long-term commitments
- Recognition and nurturance of interconnections between different aspects of life
- Balance between active responsibility and receptive attention to needs

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive recognition of and engagement with the interconnected nature of reality. It begins with simple acts of care and responsibility, gradually expanding to encompass wider circles of relationship and deeper levels of understanding. As it matures, it transforms from a series of discrete responsible actions into a seamless way of being that naturally maintains the health and harmony of one's entire sphere of influence.

In practice, it manifests as a distinctive combination of practical capability and heart-centered awareness that allows one to respond appropriately to needs across multiple dimensions simultaneously. This might appear as knowing exactly how to care for a particular place while teaching others, maintaining cultural knowledge, and strengthening community bonds - all through the same integrated actions. The quality becomes increasingly effortless as it develops, feeling less like an imposed duty and more like a natural expression of one's deepest nature.
