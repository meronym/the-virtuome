Now, transforming this into universal language:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Integrative resilience that combines physical endurance, emotional stability, and spiritual groundedness with the capacity to maintain essential integrity while adapting to challenges. This quality enables both personal fortitude and collective sustainability, expressing itself through consistent renewal and regenerative strength.

[Essential Nature]
Integrative resilience represents a dynamic synthesis of strength that operates across multiple dimensions of human experience. Unlike mere endurance or stubborn persistence, it embodies an adaptive capacity that maintains core integrity while enabling necessary transformation. This quality combines the steadiness of deeply rooted strength with the flexibility of responsive adaptation.

This form of resilience draws from and contributes to collective wellbeing, creating a regenerative cycle between individual and community strength. It manifests as a lived capacity for renewal that becomes more robust through challenges while maintaining essential connections and values.

[Manifestations]
- Physical vitality and sustainable endurance in demanding conditions
- Emotional equilibrium and recovery capacity during difficulties
- Cultural adaptability while maintaining core values and practices
- Spiritual groundedness expressing as steady presence and purpose
- Collective reinforcement through shared challenges and support
- Regenerative capacity evident in consistent renewal and growth
- Leadership through embodied strength that inspires others

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive engagement with challenges while maintaining supportive connections and practices. It operates by integrating multiple streams of strength - physical, emotional, spiritual, and social - into a coherent capacity for sustained positive adaptation. The development process involves both individual cultivation and collective participation, each reinforcing the other through shared experiences and mutual support.

In practical expression, integrative resilience manifests as a steady capability to meet life's demands while maintaining inner balance and outer connections. It enables individuals and communities to navigate challenges without losing essential character, adapting appropriately while preserving core integrity. This quality becomes evident in sustained effectiveness under pressure, consistent renewal after strain, and the ability to strengthen others through one's own stable presence.

This universalization aims to:
1. Preserve the holistic nature of the original concept
2. Maintain the individual-collective dynamic
3. Keep the practical, experiential focus
4. Highlight the regenerative aspect
5. Connect to universal human experiences
6. Retain the depth while increasing accessibility

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universalization further?
