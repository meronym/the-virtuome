[Core Definition]
The inherent and inalienable worth present in every human being, manifesting as both personal dignity and collective human nobility. This fundamental quality transcends individual circumstances, serving as the foundation for ethical treatment and mutual recognition while connecting individual worth to universal human significance.

[Essential Nature]
Human dignity exists as an intrinsic quality, independent of external circumstances or recognition, yet requiring acknowledgment for full social expression. It manifests as an internal sense of worth and an external presence that commands respect, operating simultaneously at personal and collective levels. This quality creates a field of mutual recognition where individual dignity and collective human worth reinforce each other, establishing the foundation for ethical relationships and social harmony.

[Manifestations]
- Self-possessed bearing that naturally elicits respect
- Ethical treatment of others regardless of circumstances
- Recognition and protection of human worth in all contexts
- Mutual acknowledgment between individuals and groups
- Enhancement of collective dignity through individual recognition
- Development of social structures that protect and nurture human worth
- Transformation of conflict through appeal to shared dignity

[Functional Description]
Human dignity operates as both an inherent quality and an active force, creating a reciprocal field of recognition between individuals and their community. It functions as an invisible yet tangible presence that shapes behavior, guides ethical decisions, and establishes the foundation for meaningful human interaction. When fully recognized, it naturally elicits appropriate responses from others and guides the development of ethical social structures.

In practical expression, this quality manifests through respectful treatment, ethical behavior, and the creation of conditions that support human flourishing. It guides the development of social institutions, influences conflict resolution, and shapes the character of human relationships. The recognition and protection of human dignity becomes both an individual responsibility and a collective commitment, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of ethical development and social harmony.

This universalized description aims to:
- Preserve the deep African understanding of inherent human worth
- Make the concept accessible across cultural contexts
- Maintain practical applicability
- Connect individual and collective dimensions
- Highlight both being and doing aspects
- Enable practical implementation

The description passes the verification questions by:
1. Using universal human experiences as reference points
2. Maintaining the depth of the original African concept
3. Providing clear practical applications
4. Connecting personal and universal dimensions
5. Indicating developmental aspects
6. Describing observable manifestations

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
