Let me follow the analytical process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Just and ethical ordering of human relations
Functions: 
- Maintains social harmony
- Guides conflict resolution
- Ensures fair distribution
- Protects vulnerable members
- Balances competing interests

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING
Universal experiences:
- Sense of fairness/unfairness
- Need for social order
- Experience of conflict/resolution
- Distribution of resources
- Power dynamics
- Protection of rights

3. STRUCTURAL IDENTIFICATION
Primary elements:
- Balance-seeking capacity
- Ethical discernment
- Active restoration
- Communal wisdom
Secondary elements:
- Power moderation
- Rights protection
- Resource sharing
- Conflict transformation

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The human capacity to perceive, establish, and maintain right relationships within social systems through the active balancing of interests, needs, and responsibilities. It manifests as both an inner sense of ethical rightness and the practical ability to create and restore harmony in human relations.

[Essential Nature]
Justice as a human quality emerges from our fundamental need for stable, fair, and harmonious social relations. It combines intuitive moral sensing with practical wisdom in maintaining social order. Unlike simple rule-following or abstract principles, this quality represents an active, dynamic capacity to discern and establish right relationship patterns across multiple social dimensions. It operates through both prevention and restoration, guided by a deep understanding of human needs, dignity, and interconnectedness.

[Manifestations]
- Acute awareness of power imbalances and their impacts
- Natural impulse to protect vulnerable members of a group
- Ability to find solutions that honor multiple legitimate interests
- Skill in restoring broken relationships and social bonds
- Practical wisdom in resource distribution and access
- Leadership that balances authority with responsibility
- Capacity to transform conflict into collaborative growth

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of both moral perception and practical judgment. Beginning with basic feelings of fairness/unfairness, it evolves through experience with conflict resolution, resource distribution, and power dynamics. As it matures, it integrates emotional intelligence, systemic understanding, and practical wisdom into a comprehensive capacity for maintaining social harmony.

In practice, it operates as a dynamic balancing force within human systems, continuously adjusting relationships, resources, and responsibilities to maintain optimal functioning. Rather than imposing rigid rules, it works through flexible principles that respond to context while preserving essential human dignity and communal wellbeing. This makes it particularly valuable in complex modern environments where traditional social structures are evolving or breaking down.
```

This universalization:
1. Preserves the African emphasis on relational harmony and practical wisdom
2. Translates communal focus into broader systemic understanding
3. Maintains connection between individual capacity and social function
4. Emphasizes active/dynamic nature of the quality
5. Links abstract principle to concrete manifestation
6. Provides clear developmental pathway
7. Shows contemporary relevance and application

The description meets key criteria by being:
- Culturally accessible while preserving depth
- Practically applicable across contexts
- Clear in its development and manifestation
- Connected to universal human experience
- Precise in its differentiation from related concepts

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect or adjust the description in any way?
