Let me work through this systematically for Ujima.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Collective responsibility and cooperative effort
Key functions: 
- Problem-solving through shared effort
- Resource pooling and distribution
- Community strengthening
- Shared burden management
Systemic role: Creates resilient communities through distributed responsibility

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Group challenges requiring collective effort
- Shared responsibilities in families/communities
- Mutual support networks
- Collaborative problem-solving

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary: Coordinated collective action toward shared wellbeing
Secondary: Social cohesion, resource optimization, sustainable development

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize shared challenges and mobilize collective resources, skills, and efforts to address them, creating stronger communities through coordinated action and mutual support. This quality manifests as both an individual commitment to collective wellbeing and a community's ability to work together effectively.

[Essential Nature]
At its core, this quality represents the recognition that human challenges and aspirations are inherently interconnected, requiring coordinated responses that transcend individual capabilities. It embodies the understanding that sustainable solutions emerge through the deliberate pooling of resources, skills, and efforts, creating outcomes that benefit both individual participants and the broader community. This quality operates at multiple levels simultaneously - as personal responsibility, social capability, and systemic strength.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous emergence of support networks during challenges
- Coordinated community responses to shared problems
- Efficient resource sharing and distribution systems
- Sustainable collective maintenance of common resources
- Integration of diverse skills and capabilities
- Development of collaborative decision-making processes
- Creation of mutual benefit through shared effort

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive recognition of interconnected needs and capabilities, leading to increasingly sophisticated forms of collaboration. It begins with simple shared tasks and evolves into complex systems of mutual support and collective action. The development process strengthens both individual capacity for cooperation and community-wide collaboration capabilities, creating resilient social networks capable of addressing diverse challenges.

In practice, it manifests as the ability to identify shared challenges, mobilize appropriate resources and capabilities, coordinate diverse efforts effectively, and maintain collaborative momentum until goals are achieved. This quality creates sustainable solutions by distributing both responsibility and benefits across the community, while building stronger social bonds through shared experience and achievement. The result is enhanced community resilience and increased capacity for addressing future challenges.

This universalized description:
- Preserves the core African concept of collective responsibility
- Makes it accessible to various cultural contexts
- Maintains practical applicability
- Connects individual and collective dimensions
- Shows clear developmental progression
- Provides observable manifestations
- Links to universal human experiences
- Retains philosophical sophistication
- Emphasizes practical implementation

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: ✓ (focuses on universal human experiences of collaboration)
2. Preserves depth: ✓ (maintains sophisticated understanding of collective action)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear manifestations and implementation paths)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (links personal responsibility to collective outcomes)
5. Development clarity: ✓ (shows progression from simple to complex collaboration)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (concrete, verifiable expressions)

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
