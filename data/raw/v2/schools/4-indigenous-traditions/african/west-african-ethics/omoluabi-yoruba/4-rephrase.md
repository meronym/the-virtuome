Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:

Core Principle:
- Integrated moral maturity expressed through character completeness
- Fusion of personal excellence with social responsibility
- Embodied wisdom that manifests in behavior and relationships

Key Functions:
1. Personal development framework
2. Social harmony maintenance
3. Cultural transmission vehicle
4. Ethical decision-making guide
5. Leadership development foundation

Systemic Role:
- Acts as a master virtue coordinating other qualities
- Provides developmental architecture for character formation
- Bridges individual growth and community wellbeing
- Integrates practical, social, and spiritual dimensions

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:

Universal Elements:
- Journey toward human completeness
- Integration of personal/social development
- Ethical maturity through practical wisdom
- Character as lived philosophy
- Responsibility-based dignity

Here's my attempt at the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The integrated development and expression of human completeness, manifesting as the harmony of personal excellence, social responsibility, and practical wisdom. It represents the mature embodiment of ethical awareness expressed through consistent action, relational dignity, and the natural authority of developed character.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the achievement of full human potential through the integration of various virtues into a coherent whole. Unlike isolated virtues, it emerges as a meta-quality that coordinates and expresses other virtues appropriately according to context. It manifests as a natural authority that comes not from position but from the evident maturity of character.

At its core, it embodies the principle that true human development is inseparable from social responsibility and practical wisdom. It represents not just moral knowledge but moral capability - the developed capacity to consistently act with wisdom, dignity, and care across all life domains.

[Manifestations]
- Natural ethical fluency: instinctive understanding of appropriate action in complex situations
- Relational wisdom: ability to maintain harmony while upholding principles
- Dignified presence: authority through character rather than position
- Cultural competence: deep understanding of human dynamics and social patterns
- Practical wisdom: ability to apply principles effectively in real situations
- Ethical consistency: reliable character across different contexts
- Generative influence: natural positive impact on others' development

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive integration of experience, knowledge, and ethical understanding into coherent character. It begins with learning principles but matures through practical application, reflection, and the guidance of those who embody it. The development process involves both internal cultivation and external testing through real-world challenges and relationships.

In practice, it manifests as a natural leadership quality that inspires rather than compels, teaches through example rather than instruction, and maintains social harmony through wisdom rather than force. Its presence creates a field of positive influence, naturally elevating the ethical awareness and behavior of others while contributing to collective wellbeing through the consistent expression of mature character in action.

Key Universalization Strategies Used:
1. Focused on phenomenological description over cultural concepts
2. Emphasized observable manifestations and practical impacts
3. Connected individual development to universal human potential
4. Described functional dynamics rather than prescriptive rules
5. Maintained sophistication while using accessible language
6. Preserved the integrative nature of the original concept
7. Highlighted practical wisdom and social impact aspects

Would you like me to:
1. Further refine any particular section?
2. Expand on the developmental aspects?
3. Add more practical examples?
4. Elaborate on the verification criteria?
