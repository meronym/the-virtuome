Based on this analysis, here's the universal description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The dynamic state and active process of social harmony that emerges when individuals and groups maintain balanced, life-affirming relationships within a community. It manifests as a felt sense of collective wellbeing, supported by conscious practices that nurture constructive interactions and shared flourishing.

[Essential Nature]
Wa represents the natural tendency of human communities toward harmonious equilibrium when supported by appropriate awareness and action. It operates simultaneously as a guiding principle, a lived experience, and an achieved state. Unlike passive peace or enforced order, it is an active, participatory condition requiring ongoing engagement from all community members.

This quality emerges from the recognition of fundamental human interconnectedness and manifests through practices that align individual and collective wellbeing. It builds resilience through balanced attention to relationship maintenance, conflict prevention, and collaborative problem-solving.

[Manifestations]
- Fluid social interactions characterized by mutual respect and understanding
- Efficient conflict resolution through dialogue and collective wisdom
- Balanced distribution of responsibilities and benefits within the group
- Spontaneous collaboration and mutual support in daily life
- Visible signs of collective joy and celebration
- Intergenerational knowledge transfer and cultural continuity
- Resilient response to challenges through unified action

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through iterative cycles of individual and collective growth, where personal maturation enhances group harmony, which in turn supports individual development. It requires continuous awareness of relationship dynamics, active participation in community life, and willing submission of immediate personal desires to long-term collective wellbeing when appropriate. The process is supported by cultural practices, shared ceremonies, and collaborative decision-making structures.

In practice, it manifests as a tangible atmosphere of ease and flow in social interactions, marked by ready cooperation, swift resolution of tensions, and natural emergence of leadership as needed. Community members experience a deep sense of belonging and security, enabling authentic self-expression within the context of social responsibility. This creates a sustainable foundation for both individual and collective flourishing.

This universal description aims to:
1. Capture the dynamic nature of the original concept
2. Translate cultural specifics into universal human experiences
3. Maintain practical applicability
4. Preserve philosophical sophistication
5. Enable cross-cultural understanding
6. Support practical implementation

Would you like me to:
1. Expand on any particular aspect?
2. Provide more specific examples of manifestations?
3. Elaborate on development methods?
4. Add comparative analysis with similar concepts?
