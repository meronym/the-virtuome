Let me follow the process systematically:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Ọgbọ́n:
Core principle: Integration of knowledge, experience, and judgment
Functions: Decision-making, guidance, problem-solving, mentoring
Systemic role: Knowledge transmission, community wisdom, ethical judgment
Developmental: Accumulated through experience, mentorship, observation

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences: Learning from experience, pattern recognition, judgment formation
Parallel concepts: Practical wisdom, experiential intelligence, mature judgment
Contemporary relevance: Decision-making, leadership, personal development
Timeless patterns: Knowledge-action integration, experience-based learning

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
Primary:
- Integration of knowledge and action
- Pattern recognition and application
- Ethical discernment
- Social intelligence

Secondary:
- Overcoming impulsiveness
- Requiring time and reflection
- Building through experience
- Community validation

Here's the universalized description following the requested format:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to integrate knowledge, experience, and ethical understanding into wise action, characterized by the ability to recognize deeper patterns in life situations and respond with mature judgment that serves both individual and collective wellbeing.

[Essential Nature]
Practical wisdom represents the marriage of understanding and action, where knowledge becomes embodied through experience and reflection. It manifests as an intuitive grasp of complex situations, enabling responses that address both immediate circumstances and broader implications. This quality transcends mere intellectual knowledge or accumulated facts, emerging instead as a dynamic capacity to perceive, judge, and act in ways that align with fundamental principles while adapting to specific contexts.

[Manifestations]
- Demonstrated ability to see beyond surface appearances to underlying patterns
- Balanced judgment that considers multiple perspectives and long-term implications
- Effective guidance that helps others develop their own understanding
- Natural authority that comes from demonstrated wisdom rather than position
- Integration of past experience with present challenges
- Capacity to identify essential principles in complex situations
- Ability to translate understanding into appropriate action

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the progressive integration of experience, reflection, and understanding, creating an embodied wisdom that operates more like intuitive recognition than calculated analysis. It builds through cycles of action, observation, and reflection, gradually forming internal patterns that enable increasingly refined judgment and more effective action.

In practice, it manifests as the ability to navigate complex situations with mature judgment, offer guidance that catalyzes others' development, and make decisions that serve both immediate needs and longer-term wellbeing. This wisdom becomes evident through consistently sound judgment, the ability to mentor others effectively, and the capacity to resolve complex challenges in ways that strengthen community bonds while honoring fundamental principles.
