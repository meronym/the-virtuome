Let me follow the process step by step.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS OF TERANGA:
- Core principle: Radical openness/expansive inclusivity
- Key functions: Community cohesion, social integration, resource distribution
- Systemic role: Creates resilient social fabric through active sharing
- Developmental aspect: Transforms individual resources into communal wealth

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
- Universal experiences: Giving/receiving, belonging, sharing, welcoming
- Parallel concepts: Hospitality, generosity, community-building, social capital
- Contemporary relevance: Social cohesion, immigration, resource distribution
- Timeless patterns: Human interdependence, social reciprocity, collective care

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to transform individual resources into collective wellbeing through radical openness and active sharing, creating an expansive field of belonging that strengthens social fabric through intentional inclusion and generous engagement with others.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the active principle of social expansion through practical generosity, manifesting as a dynamic force that converts private abundance into communal wealth. It operates through conscious dissolution of boundaries between self and other, transforming the act of sharing from a transaction into a way of being.

At its core lies the recognition that human flourishing is inherently collective, expressed through the practical wisdom that resources grow through circulation rather than accumulation. This understanding manifests as both an attitude and a practice, creating spaces of belonging through material and emotional generosity.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous sharing of resources without calculation of return
- Active creation of inclusive spaces that welcome the stranger
- Transformation of private spaces into communal gathering points
- Regular redistribution of material and social resources
- Recognition and engagement of others' full humanity
- Creation of reciprocal networks of care and support
- Development of social resilience through resource circulation

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through the systematic transformation of boundaries into bridges, working simultaneously at material and social levels. It begins with recognition of abundance rather than scarcity, leading to practical actions that convert individual resources into collective wealth. The process creates expanding circles of inclusion, each act of sharing strengthening the social fabric while generating new opportunities for connection and exchange.

In practice, it manifests as a dynamic balance of giving and receiving that transcends simple transaction. It creates resilient communities through the continuous circulation of resources, knowledge, and care. This circulation generates a self-reinforcing cycle where increased sharing leads to greater collective abundance, which in turn enables more sharing. The result is a robust social ecosystem characterized by active participation, mutual support, and sustainable growth.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? Yes - focuses on universal human experiences of sharing and belonging
2. Preserves depth? Yes - captures both practical and philosophical dimensions
3. Practically applicable? Yes - clear observable manifestations and mechanisms
4. Individual-universal connection? Yes - links personal action to collective wellbeing
5. Development clarity? Yes - shows progression from attitude to practice to system
6. Observable manifestations? Yes - concrete, verifiable expressions listed

The description maintains the essence of Teranga while making it accessible and relevant across cultural contexts. It preserves the sophistication of the original concept while expressing it in universal terms that connect to common human experience.

Would you like me to:
1. Expand any particular aspect?
2. Add more practical examples?
3. Clarify the development process?
4. Compare with parallel concepts?
