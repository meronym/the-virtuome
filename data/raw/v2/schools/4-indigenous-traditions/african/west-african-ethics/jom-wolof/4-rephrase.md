Let me follow the process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of JOM:
Core principle: Integration of personal dignity with social responsibility
Key functions: Self-regulation, moral courage, honor maintenance
Systemic role: Maintains social fabric through individual integrity
Developmental: Progresses from external honor to internalized dignity

2. UNIVERSALIZATION:
Universal experiences: Self-respect, moral conviction, integrity
Parallel concepts: Dignity, honor, moral courage, self-possession
Contemporary relevance: Personal boundaries, ethical leadership, moral resilience
Timeless patterns: Integration of personal worth with social responsibility

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
Primary: Personal sovereignty expressed through ethical conduct
Secondary: Balance of rights and duties, individual-collective harmony

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The integration of personal dignity with moral responsibility, expressed as an unshakeable commitment to ethical conduct and social contribution. It manifests as a form of noble self-possession that naturally extends into protective care for collective well-being and social harmony.

[Essential Nature]
At its core, this quality represents the mature development of human dignity - not as mere self-respect, but as an active force that shapes behavior and social interactions. It emerges when personal sovereignty fully aligns with social responsibility, creating a form of ethical autonomy that naturally upholds both individual integrity and community welfare. This quality transcends simple honor or pride, embodying instead a profound understanding of human worth that demands consistent ethical action.

[Manifestations]
- Unwavering adherence to personal principles despite external pressures
- Natural assumption of responsibility for others' well-being
- Dignified restraint in speech and action, especially under provocation
- Protective strength that defends both personal and collective dignity
- Ethical leadership that emerges from character rather than position
- Confident humility that commands respect without demanding it

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through the continuous alignment of internal values with external actions, creating a seamless integration of personal dignity and social responsibility. It develops through progressive internalization of ethical principles, moving from learned behaviors to embodied wisdom, ultimately becoming an autonomous force for individual and collective elevation. The process requires consistent self-reflection and conscious choice in challenging situations.

In practice, it manifests as a distinctive presence that naturally earns respect and trust. Those embodying this quality demonstrate unusual resilience in maintaining ethical standards under pressure, while simultaneously showing genuine concern for collective welfare. Their actions consistently reflect a deep understanding of the inseparable nature of personal dignity and social responsibility, creating a sphere of positive influence that naturally elevates those around them.

This universalization aims to:
1. Preserve the deep integration of personal and collective aspects central to Jom
2. Maintain the sophisticated understanding of dignity as active rather than passive
3. Capture the developmental aspect from external honor to internalized wisdom
4. Keep the practical focus on observable behavior and social impact
5. Make the concept accessible while maintaining its philosophical depth

Would you like me to:
1. Further refine any particular aspect?
2. Develop specific contemporary applications?
3. Elaborate on the developmental process?
4. Compare with parallel concepts from other traditions?
