Let me follow the structured process to universalize Uja-Umoja:

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Integration of individual development with collective flourishing
Key functions: 
- Identity formation through relationship
- Mutual growth facilitation
- Social cohesion generation
- Collective capacity building
- Individual actualization through community

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Belonging needs
- Identity formation through relationships
- Collective achievement
- Mutual support systems
- Social learning

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to develop one's full human potential through active participation in collective life, recognizing and embodying the fundamental interconnection between individual growth and community flourishing. This quality manifests as the ability to simultaneously strengthen both personal capability and social fabric through engaged relationship.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents a fundamental pattern in human development where individual growth and collective flourishing form an integrated dynamic system. Unlike simple cooperation or group participation, it reflects a deeper recognition that human development is inherently relational - not just supported by relationships, but constituted through them. It operates through active engagement in collective life while maintaining individual authenticity, creating reciprocal growth patterns where personal development automatically strengthens community, and community participation inevitably develops the individual.

[Manifestations]
- Ability to learn and grow through genuine participation in group endeavors
- Natural tendency to consider collective impact in personal decisions
- Capacity to strengthen others through one's own development
- Skill in finding alignment between personal and collective needs
- Pattern of contributing to group capability while developing individual excellence
- Authentic individual expression that naturally enriches collective life
- Creation of growth-supporting relationships and environments

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic integration of individual agency and collective participation. Rather than subordinating one to the other, it creates virtuous cycles where personal growth naturally contributes to collective capability, and participation in collective life inevitably develops individual capacity. It manifests through the recognition and activation of the inherent connections between personal and collective development.

In practice, this quality enables individuals to pursue their unique path of development in ways that automatically strengthen their communities, while simultaneously engaging in collective life in ways that naturally develop their individual capabilities. It creates resilient social systems where individual excellence and collective flourishing become mutually reinforcing rather than competing priorities.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: Yes - speaks to universal human experiences of development through relationship
2. Depth preservation: Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding of individual-collective integration
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear implications for personal development and social organization
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - explicitly addresses this relationship
5. Developmental clarity: Yes - describes both individual and collective growth patterns
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - listed behaviors and patterns can be identified and verified

The translation preserves the sophisticated insights of Uja-Umoja while making them accessible to those outside its original cultural context. It maintains both philosophical depth and practical applicability while speaking to universal human experiences of development through relationship.
