Let me follow the process systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Integration of experiential knowledge, moral insight, and practical judgment
Key functions:
- Discernment in complex situations
- Guidance of others
- Balancing tradition and adaptation
- Resolution of conflicts
- Integration of knowledge types

Relationship patterns:
- Elder to community
- Individual to collective wisdom
- Theory to practice
- Past to present
- Knowledge to action

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING
Universal experiences:
- Learning from experience
- Developing judgment
- Navigating complexity
- Guiding others
- Integrating knowledge and practice

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS
Primary:
- Integrative understanding
- Practical judgment
- Experiential learning
- Social intelligence

Secondary:
- Pattern recognition
- Contextual adaptation
- Knowledge synthesis
- Ethical discernment

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to integrate deep understanding with practical judgment, enabling one to discern appropriate action in complex situations while maintaining awareness of broader patterns and longer-term implications. It manifests as the ability to synthesize experience, knowledge, and insight into reliable guidance for both self and others.

[Essential Nature]
Integrative wisdom represents a dynamic synthesis of multiple ways of knowing and understanding. It transcends mere accumulation of knowledge or experience, emerging instead as a refined capacity for discernment that encompasses practical, ethical, and relational dimensions. This quality develops through the conscious integration of direct experience, reflected understanding, and pattern recognition, leading to increasingly nuanced judgment and more effective action.

Rather than just experiential knowledge or intellectual understanding alone, it manifests as a practical intelligence that can recognize deeper patterns, anticipate consequences, and guide action in ways that serve both immediate needs and longer-term development. It inherently includes awareness of interconnection between individual and collective wellbeing.

[Manifestations]
- Ability to recognize patterns and principles beneath surface appearances
- Capacity to offer guidance that addresses both immediate situations and developmental needs
- Skill in finding solutions that serve multiple levels of benefit
- Natural integration of practical effectiveness with ethical consideration
- Balance between respecting established wisdom and adapting to new contexts
- Recognition of appropriate timing and approach in complex situations
- Ability to translate deep understanding into accessible guidance

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through continuous integration of multiple streams of understanding: direct experience, reflected knowledge, pattern recognition, and ethical discernment. It develops through intentional engagement with increasingly complex situations while maintaining reflective awareness of both processes and outcomes. The development process involves both active learning from experience and receptive integration of inherited wisdom, creating an ever-deepening capacity for nuanced understanding and effective action.

In practical expression, it manifests as reliable judgment in complex situations, skillful guidance of others, and the ability to find solutions that serve multiple needs simultaneously. This quality enables one to navigate challenging circumstances while maintaining awareness of broader contexts and longer-term implications, leading to actions that are both immediately effective and developmentally beneficial. It naturally expresses itself through both practical problem-solving and the ability to cultivate wisdom in others.

This universalization maintains the depth and sophistication of the original East African concept while making it accessible and relevant across cultural contexts. It preserves the integration of practical and ethical dimensions central to Hekima while expressing them in terms of universal human experience and development.

The description emphasizes observable manifestations and practical applications while retaining the deeper philosophical understanding of how this quality functions in human development and social life. It connects individual development to collective benefit, reflecting the original concept's social dimension without requiring specific cultural context to be understood.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this universalization or analyze how it meets specific verification criteria?
