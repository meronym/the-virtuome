Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Conscious stewardship arising from recognition of interconnection
Key functions:
- Multi-generational consideration
- Resource stewardship
- Community obligation fulfillment
- Cultural preservation
- Sacred duty awareness

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Care for family/community
- Environmental impact awareness
- Future planning
- Resource management
- Duty recognition
- Impact consideration

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary patterns:
- Recognition → Consideration → Action → Impact
- Individual → Family → Community → Environment → Future
- Knowledge → Obligation → Stewardship → Legacy

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, accept, and consciously fulfill one's role in the continuing web of life, manifesting as careful consideration of long-term impacts, mindful stewardship of resources, and active fulfillment of obligations to both present and future generations.

[Essential Nature]
Responsibility emerges from the growing awareness of our interconnection with and impact upon the wider web of life. It represents the mature human capacity to hold multiple perspectives simultaneously - past, present, and future - while making choices that honor these connections. Unlike simple duty or obligation, responsibility encompasses both the awareness of relationship and the willing acceptance of our power to affect outcomes.

This quality develops through expanding circles of consideration, moving from immediate personal impacts to broader temporal and spatial horizons, ultimately embracing the full scope of our influence on future generations and the living world.

[Manifestations]
- Careful consideration before action, weighing multiple impacts and timeframes
- Consistent follow-through on commitments, even when challenging
- Active stewardship of resources beyond immediate personal needs
- Voluntary acceptance of duties that serve community welfare
- Recognition and honoring of one's impact on future generations
- Integration of long-term thinking into daily decisions
- Balanced attention to preservation and development

[Functional Description]
Responsibility operates through three interconnected mechanisms: awareness of impact (the ability to perceive the ripple effects of our actions), acceptance of influence (the recognition of our power to affect outcomes), and conscious stewardship (the active care for what has been entrusted to us). This quality grows through expanding circles of consideration, each level incorporating broader temporal and spatial awareness into decision-making.

In practical expression, responsibility manifests as a natural integration of future consideration into present action. It appears as careful resource use, thoughtful decision-making, reliable follow-through, and active care for community welfare. Rather than feeling like an imposed burden, mature responsibility emerges as a natural expression of understanding one's place in the larger web of life.

This universalization maintains the deep ecological and multi-generational awareness central to the Native American concept while expressing it in terms accessible to contemporary global understanding. It preserves the spiritual dimension through reference to the "web of life" while grounding the concept in observable behaviors and practical applications.

The description connects individual actions to universal impacts, maintains the sophistication of long-term thinking, and provides clear markers for both development and expression of the quality. It should be meaningful across cultures while remaining true to the original concept's depth.

Would you like me to further develop any aspect of this universalization?
