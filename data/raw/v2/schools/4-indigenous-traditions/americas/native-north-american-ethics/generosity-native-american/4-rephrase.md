Let me follow the systematic process for Generosity.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Active participation in life's flow of resources and support
Key functions:
- Resource distribution
- Community strengthening
- Abundance cultivation
- Relationship building
- Welfare maintenance

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Giving and receiving
- Sharing limited resources
- Supporting others
- Experiencing abundance/scarcity
- Building trust through sharing

3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Primary Elements:
- Freely giving of resources/self
- Recognition of interconnection
- Active participation in welfare of others
- Cultivation of abundance mindset

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The conscious participation in life's natural flow of resources and support through freely giving of one's material and non-material gifts, recognizing abundance as a dynamic state sustained through circulation rather than accumulation, and actively contributing to the welfare of the greater whole.

[Essential Nature]
Generosity emerges from the recognition that all resources - material, emotional, spiritual, and temporal - exist within a living network of circulation and exchange. It manifests as the natural impulse to participate in this flow, unrestricted by excessive attachment or fear of scarcity. This quality transcends mere material giving, encompassing the sharing of time, attention, knowledge, and presence.

At its core, generosity reflects the understanding that individual wellbeing is inseparable from collective flourishing, and that abundance increases through sharing rather than hoarding. It represents active participation in life's fundamental pattern of give and take.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous sharing of resources without expectation of return
- Active attention to and support of others' needs and wellbeing
- Free offering of time, knowledge, and skills to benefit others
- Maintenance of an open, abundant perspective despite circumstances
- Creation of opportunities for others to grow and flourish
- Cultivation of communal resources and shared prosperity
- Recognition and facilitation of others' contributions

[Functional Description]
Generosity operates through the dissolution of artificial boundaries between self and other, transforming the perception of resources from personal possessions into shared elements of collective wellbeing. It develops through progressive recognition of interconnection and repeated experiences of abundance through sharing, gradually replacing scarcity-based patterns with trust in life's natural provision.

In practice, generosity creates expanding circles of prosperity and support, strengthening social bonds and building resilient communities. It manifests in both planned and spontaneous giving, ranging from material sharing to subtle forms of emotional and spiritual support. The quality grows through exercise, with each generous act reinforcing the understanding of abundance as a flow rather than a static possession.

This universalization:
1. Preserves the Indigenous understanding of generosity as participation in natural flow rather than mere giving
2. Maintains the connection between individual and collective wellbeing
3. Includes both material and non-material dimensions
4. Emphasizes the dynamic, active nature of the quality
5. Links personal practice to universal patterns
6. Provides clear markers for development and manifestation

The description avoids culture-specific references while maintaining the sophisticated understanding present in the Native American conception of generosity as a fundamental life principle rather than just a moral virtue.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this universalization?
