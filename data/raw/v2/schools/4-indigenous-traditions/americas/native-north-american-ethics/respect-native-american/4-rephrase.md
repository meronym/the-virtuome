Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Recognition of inherent dignity/sacredness
Functions: 
- Maintains right relationships
- Guides behavior/interaction
- Establishes boundaries
- Ensures proper recognition
- Facilitates harmony

Systemic roles:
- Foundation for other virtues
- Social cohesion mechanism
- Environmental stewardship basis
- Cultural continuity enabler

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING
Universal experiences:
- Recognition of worth beyond utility
- Sense of appropriate boundaries
- Awareness of interconnection
- Experience of reverence
- Recognition of dignity

3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS
Primary:
- Recognition of inherent worth
- Appropriate response to value
- Behavioral manifestation
- Relationship maintenance

Secondary:
- Self-centered blindness (obstacle)
- Mindful awareness (condition)
- Humility (related quality)
- Reverence (related quality)

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize and respond appropriately to inherent worth and dignity, manifesting as careful attention to boundaries, deliberate acknowledgment of value, and conscious maintenance of right relationship with all beings, systems, and principles that compose reality.

[Essential Nature]
Respect emerges from the fundamental human capacity to recognize value beyond utility and respond appropriately to this recognition. It operates as both a perceptual faculty - allowing us to discern inherent worth - and a responsive capability that guides behavior, shapes relationships, and maintains appropriate boundaries.

This quality functions as a primary ordering principle in human experience, mediating relationships between self and other, known and unknown, immediate and transcendent. It manifests as a form of careful attention that simultaneously acknowledges boundaries and creates connection.

[Manifestations]
- Careful attention to boundaries, limits, and appropriate distance
- Deliberate acknowledgment of worth through word, gesture, and action
- Mindful consideration of impact before acting or speaking
- Protection and preservation of what holds value
- Recognition of dignity in self and others despite circumstances
- Maintenance of appropriate relationship despite emotional states
- Active cultivation of harmony through conscious interaction

[Functional Description]
Respect operates through a dual process of recognition and response. The recognition component involves a direct perception of inherent worth or dignity, independent of utility or personal benefit. This perception triggers an automatic calibration of behavior, adjusting our approach and interaction to maintain appropriate relationship with what we've recognized. This process can be cultivated through practice, becoming increasingly refined and comprehensive in its operation.

In practical expression, respect manifests as a quality of careful attention that naturally regulates behavior and shapes interaction. It creates a field of appropriate relationship, maintaining necessary boundaries while enabling genuine connection. This quality can be observed in physical posture, tone of voice, choice of words, timing of actions, and the overall pattern of engagement with others and environment. When fully developed, it becomes a stable lens through which all experience is processed and all action is initiated.

This universalized description aims to:
1. Capture the depth of the Indigenous concept while making it accessible
2. Preserve the relational/systemic aspects while expressing them in universal terms
3. Maintain practical applicability while addressing theoretical depth
4. Connect individual experience to universal principles
5. Provide clear developmental pathway and observable manifestations

Would you like me to adjust any aspects of this universalization to better meet the objectives?
