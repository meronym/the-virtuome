Let me follow the process step by step.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Sacred reciprocity as fundamental pattern of life
Key functions:
- Maintains balance in relationships
- Ensures sustainable exchange
- Creates social cohesion
- Aligns human with cosmic order
Systemic role: Organizing principle for relationships at all levels

2. UNIVERSALIZATION PROCESS
Universal experiences:
- Give and take in relationships
- Natural cycles and rhythms
- Mutual dependence
- Balance and harmony seeking
Contemporary parallels:
- Ecosystem dynamics
- Social capital
- Sustainable systems
- Network reciprocity

3. STRUCTURAL MAPPING
Primary:
- Balance-seeking dynamic
- Cyclical exchange
- Mutual support patterns
- Multi-level integration
Secondary:
- Relationship sustainability
- Community resilience
- Environmental harmony
- Personal development

Now, the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The fundamental dynamic of life-sustaining exchange through which balanced relationships are maintained and nourished at all levels - from personal interactions to cosmic processes. This conscious participation in the give-and-take pattern of existence enables sustainable growth, harmonious development, and the flourishing of interconnected systems.

[Essential Nature]
At its core, this quality represents the recognition and conscious embodiment of life's inherent reciprocal nature. It manifests as an active awareness of the circular flow of giving and receiving that sustains all living systems. Unlike simple transactional exchange, it operates through deeply felt understanding of interconnection and commitment to maintaining dynamic balance. This quality emerges from experiential recognition that all aspects of life exist in networks of mutual support and influence, requiring conscious participation in sustainable patterns of exchange.

[Manifestations]
- Naturally balanced give-and-take in relationships without keeping score
- Intuitive awareness of appropriate timing in exchanges
- Sustainable resource use that considers future cycles
- Active contribution to community wellbeing
- Recognition and response to others' needs without prompt
- Development of long-term, resilient relationship networks
- Integration of personal actions with larger systemic health

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through heightened awareness of interdependence combined with active participation in cycles of exchange. It develops through progressive recognition of ever-wider circles of relationship and responsibility, moving from simple interpersonal exchanges to understanding of one's role in maintaining broader systemic health. The capacity grows through practical experience of giving and receiving in sustainable patterns, supported by reflection on the outcomes of different exchange dynamics.

In practice, this quality enables individuals and groups to create and maintain healthy, sustainable relationships at all scales. It manifests as natural generosity balanced with appropriate receiving, timely response to needs, and intuitive understanding of how to maintain long-term relationship health. This creates resilient support networks, efficient resource distribution, and harmonious community dynamics while fostering personal growth through expanded relationship awareness.

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural? Yes - based on universal patterns of exchange and relationship
2. Preserves depth? Yes - maintains sacred/cosmic dimension while making it accessible
3. Practical? Yes - clear applications in relationships and systems
4. Individual-Universal connection? Yes - links personal practice to systemic health
5. Development clear? Yes - shows progression from simple to complex understanding
6. Observable? Yes - concrete manifestations in behavior and relationships

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
