Let me work through this systematically for Yachay.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Integration of knowledge, experience, and action
Key functions: 
- Practical wisdom acquisition
- Knowledge embodiment
- Experiential learning
- Wisdom transmission

Universal experiences:
- Learning through practice
- Growing through experience
- Developing practical mastery
- Teaching through example

Here's my attempt at the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to embody and express wisdom through direct experience and practical action, integrating knowledge, understanding, and skillful conduct. It represents the dynamic fusion of learning and doing, where wisdom manifests as both deep knowing and effective action in service of life.

[Essential Nature]
Experiential wisdom represents the integration of understanding and action, where knowledge becomes fully embodied through practice and direct experience. Unlike purely intellectual knowledge, it emerges through active engagement with life's challenges and opportunities, developing through cycles of action, reflection, and refinement. This wisdom manifests as an intimate knowing that seamlessly guides conduct, combining deep understanding with practical effectiveness.

It operates as a dynamic capacity that grows through engagement rather than a static body of knowledge to be acquired. The development of this quality involves progressive refinement through experience, where understanding deepens through application and practice enriches comprehension.

[Manifestations]
- Seamless integration of knowledge and action in responding to situations
- Natural authority that comes from demonstrated mastery rather than position
- Ability to adapt principles to new contexts while maintaining essential understanding
- Capacity to transmit knowledge through demonstration and guided experience
- Pattern recognition that allows anticipation of developments and consequences
- Practical effectiveness combined with deep understanding of principles
- Teaching ability that helps others develop through their own experience

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive cycles of learning, application, and reflection. Each experience becomes an opportunity for deeper understanding, while each insight seeks expression through practical action. The process requires active engagement with real challenges, willingness to learn from outcomes, and continuous refinement of both understanding and implementation. The development moves from initial knowledge through practiced skill to embodied wisdom that operates spontaneously and effectively.

In practical expression, this wisdom manifests as natural authority in action, where understanding and effectiveness are seamlessly united. It shows in the ability to address novel situations appropriately, to teach others through guided experience, and to maintain perspective while engaged in action. The quality enables both personal mastery and the capacity to foster development in others, serving as a bridge between knowledge and its practical expression in service of life.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaningfulness: ✓ 
- Focuses on universal human experience of learning through practice
- Avoids culture-specific references
- Describes recognizable patterns of development

2. Preservation of depth: ✓
- Maintains integration of knowing and doing
- Preserves teaching/transmission aspect
- Retains connection to practical wisdom tradition

3. Practical applicability: ✓
- Clear progression of development
- Observable manifestations
- Concrete functional description

4. Individual-Universal connection: ✓
- Links personal development to universal patterns
- Shows relationship between individual mastery and teaching others
- Connects practical skill to deeper principles

5. Developmental clarity: ✓
- Progressive cycles of learning and application
- Clear pathway from knowledge through skill to wisdom
- Explicit about how the quality grows

6. Observable manifestations: ✓
- Concrete behavioral indicators
- Verifiable expressions
- Practical outcomes

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
