UNIVERSALIZATION ATTEMPT:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The art of integrated flourishing - a dynamic state of wellbeing where personal fulfillment, social harmony, and ecological balance reinforce each other through conscious living. It manifests as a sustainable prosperity that enriches all dimensions of life without depleting any.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the sophisticated achievement of multi-dimensional wellbeing, where individual thriving supports and is supported by collective prosperity and environmental health. Unlike simpler concepts of "happiness" or "success," it describes a complex dynamic balance where different aspects of life - personal, interpersonal, communal, and ecological - create reinforcing patterns of sustainable flourishing.

It operates as both an organizing principle for human activity and a developmental goal, providing practical guidance for choices while inspiring ever-deeper realization of human potential in harmony with all life.

[Manifestations]
- Personal: Deep satisfaction, meaningful engagement, continuous growth, balanced lifestyle
- Interpersonal: Nurturing relationships, constructive collaboration, mutual support
- Communal: Cultural vitality, shared prosperity, effective cooperation, intergenerational care
- Ecological: Sustainable practices, environmental stewardship, balanced resource use
- Economic: Sufficient prosperity, fair distribution, sustainable production/consumption
- Developmental: Ongoing learning, capacity building, wisdom cultivation
- Spiritual: Meaningful connection, purpose alignment, sacred awareness

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive integration of various life dimensions, beginning with personal practices of conscious living and extending to ever-wider spheres of relationship and impact. It requires continuous attention to feedback across systems - personal wellbeing reflects and affects family health, which influences community vitality, which shapes ecological balance. Success in one domain supports and requires success in others.

In practice, it manifests as lifestyle choices that simultaneously benefit self, others, and environment; economic activities that generate prosperity without exploitation; social arrangements that support both individual development and collective good; and cultural patterns that maintain balanced relationships between human communities and natural systems. The result is a dynamic, sustainable flourishing that enriches rather than depletes the web of life.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural relevance: ✓ (addresses universal human aspirations)
2. Depth preservation: ✓ (maintains sophisticated systemic understanding)
3. Practical applicability: ✓ (clear manifestations and implementation paths)
4. Individual-universal connection: ✓ (links personal choices to systemic impacts)
5. Developmental clarity: ✓ (shows progression from personal to universal)
6. Observable manifestations: ✓ (concrete indicators across domains)

The universalization maintains the sophisticated systems thinking of the original while making it accessible through common human experiences and practical manifestations. It preserves the holistic nature while providing clear pathways for implementation.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this universalization?
