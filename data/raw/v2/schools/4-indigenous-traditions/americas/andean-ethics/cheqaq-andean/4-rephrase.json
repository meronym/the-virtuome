Note that many of these concepts come from Quechua and Aymara traditions, particularly as preserved through oral histories, archaeological evidence, colonial-era chronicles, and living practices.\n\nCORE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND VIRTUES:\n\n1. Fundamental Organizing Principles:\n- Ayni (reciprocity/mutual aid)\n- Yanantin (complementary duality)\n- Masintin (cyclic reciprocity)\n- Pachakuti (transformative renewal)\n\n2. Social-Relational Virtues:\n- Llank'ay (sacred work/productive activity)\n- Yanapay (solidarity/helping others)\n- Mink'a (collective work for common good)\n- Rimanakuy (respectful dialogue/consensus building)\n\n3. Environmental-Cosmic Virtues:\n- Sumaq Kawsay (harmonious living)\n- Allpa Mama Yupaychay (earth respect)\n- Kawsay Pacha (life-force awareness)\n- Uywana (careful stewardship)\n\n4. Personal Character Virtues:\n- Cheka Sunt'u (truthfulness/authenticity)\n- Yachay (wisdom/knowledge seeking)\n- K'uchi (joyful disposition)\n- Kallpa (inner strength/resilience)\n\n5. Community Leadership Virtues:\n- Khuyaq Sunqu (compassionate heart)\n- Allin Yachachiq (good teaching/guidance)\n- Kamachiq (just authority)\n- Qhapaq (noble wisdom)\n\n6. Spiritual-Religious Virtues:\n- Munay (pure love/will)\n- Yuyay (mindful remembrance)\n- Chanin (reverence/sacred respect)\n- Wak'a Yupaychay (honoring sacred places)\n\n7. Family/Kinship Virtues:\n- Ayllu Khuyay (family/community love)\n- Kuraq Yupaychay (elder respect)\n- Wawa Khuyay (child nurturing)\n- Yawar Masi (blood bonds honor)\n\n8. Economic Virtues:\n- Rakirinakuy (fair distribution)\n- Wakcha Khuyaq (care for the poor)\n- Qhapaq Kani (sufficiency without excess)\n- Pirwa (abundance sharing)\n\n9. Justice-Related Virtues:\n- Cheqaq (justice/fairness)\n- Allin Ruway (right action)\n- Llank'ay Chanin (honest work)\n- Kamachi (proper order)\n\n10. Ecological Virtues:\n- Pachamama Yupaychay (Earth Mother reverence)\n- Tarpuy Yachay (wise cultivation)\n- Kawsay Qhaway (life protection)\n- Pacha Mama Uywana (Earth stewardship)\n\nImportant contextual notes:\n\n1. Many of these concepts are deeply interconnected and cannot be fully understood in isolation\n\n2. These virtues often exist within a cosmological framework that doesn't separate spiritual/material realms\n\n3. Many concepts have regional variations and different expressions across Andean cultures\n\n4. Contemporary interpretations often blend traditional understanding with modern applications\n\n5. Some concepts are reconstructed from historical sources and living traditions\n\n6. The translation/interpretation of these concepts into discrete \"virtues\" is somewhat artificial, as they exist within a holistic worldview\n\nThis list represents a synthesis from various sources including:\n- Archaeological evidence\n- Colonial chronicles\n- Oral traditions\n- Contemporary anthropological studies\n- Living Indigenous practices\n- Modern Indigenous scholarship\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect or move forward with creating detailed YAML nodes for specific virtues?"

Initial Concept Analysis\n- Identify the virtue's core principle/phenomenon\n- List key functions and manifestations\n- Note relationship patterns and systemic roles\n- Map developmental aspects\n\n2. Universalization Process\n- Identify universal human experiences it relates to\n- Find parallel concepts across contexts\n- Note contemporary relevance/applications\n- Identify timeless patterns/principles\n\n3. Structural Analysis\nPrimary Elements:\n- Essential nature/core function\n- Observable manifestations\n- Developmental trajectory\n- Systemic relationships\n\nSecondary Elements:\n- Common obstacles/challenges\n- Supporting conditions\n- Related qualities\n- Practical applications\n\nCOMPOSITION GUIDELINES:\n1. Language:\n- Use phenomenological rather than theoretical language\n- Prefer experiential descriptions over abstract concepts\n- Balance precision with accessibility\n- Avoid culture-specific references\n\n2. Structure:\n- Start with clearest, most fundamental aspect\n- Build complexity progressively\n- Connect abstract principles to concrete manifestations\n- Link individual to universal aspects\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```markdown\n[Core Definition]\nSingle paragraph capturing fundamental essence\n(50-75 words)\n\n[Essential Nature]\nDeeper elaboration of the quality's nature and function\n(100-150 words)\n\n[Manifestations]\n- Observable expressions (4-7 bullet points)\n- Developmental aspects\n- Practical implementations\n- Relationship patterns\n\n[Functional Description]\nHow this quality operates and develops in human experience\nTwo paragraphs:\n1. Operation/mechanism (75-100 words)\n2. Practical expression/impact (75-100 words)\n```\n\nQUALITY CRITERIA:\n1. Comprehensiveness:\n- Captures full depth of original concept\n- Addresses multiple dimensions (personal/interpersonal/universal)\n- Includes both theoretical and practical aspects\n\n2. Accessibility:\n- Understandable without specialized knowledge\n- Relatable to common experience\n- Practical and applicable\n\n3. Precision:\n- Clear differentiation from related concepts\n- Specific rather than vague descriptions\n- Accurate to original meaning\n\n4. Relevance:\n- Contemporary applications clear\n- Universal human significance evident\n- Practical value apparent\n\nVERIFICATION QUESTIONS:\n1. Would this description be meaningful across cultures?\n2. Does it preserve the depth of the original concept?\n3. Is it practically applicable?\n4. Does it connect individual to universal aspects?\n5. Is it clear how this quality develops?\n6. Are the manifestations observable/verifiable?\n\nUPDATED SCOPE: Please focus on the following virtue: Cheqaq. Follow the provided preparation instructions, composition guidelines, and output format to create a universal language description of the virtue."
