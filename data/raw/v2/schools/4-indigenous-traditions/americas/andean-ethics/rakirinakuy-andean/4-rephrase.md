Let me follow the systematic process to universalize Rakirinakuy.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Just distribution and sharing enabling collective wellbeing
Key functions: Resource balancing, community sustenance, prosperity maintenance
Systemic role: Economic harmony, social cohesion, sustainable abundance
Developmental aspects: From basic sharing to systemic stewardship

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Resource distribution challenges
- Collective wellbeing needs
- Abundance/scarcity dynamics
- Community interdependence

Parallel concepts:
- Economic justice
- Resource stewardship
- Distributive fairness
- Collective prosperity

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The conscious practice of fair distribution and resource stewardship that creates sustainable collective prosperity through balanced sharing. This quality manifests as the capacity to maintain economic harmony while ensuring both individual needs and community wellbeing are met through ethical resource management.

[Essential Nature]
At its core, this quality represents the deep understanding that true prosperity emerges from balanced distribution rather than accumulation. It operates as an active principle of economic harmony that recognizes how individual and collective wellbeing are intertwined through resource flows. Unlike simple charity or mandatory redistribution, it embodies the conscious stewarding of resources in ways that enhance the vitality and resilience of the whole system while respecting individual dignity.

[Manifestations]
- Conscious attention to resource distribution patterns
- Active balancing of individual and collective needs
- Development of sustainable sharing systems
- Creation of abundance through circulation
- Stewardship of communal resources
- Recognition and response to systemic imbalances
- Cultivation of economic harmony through ethical distribution

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through growing awareness of resource interconnections and their impact on collective wellbeing. It begins with simple acts of sharing and evolves into sophisticated understanding of economic harmony. As it matures, it enables one to perceive and manage complex resource flows while maintaining balance between individual agency and collective needs.

In practice, it manifests as the capacity to create and maintain systems of ethical resource distribution that enhance rather than diminish individual dignity. It generates sustainable prosperity by ensuring resources circulate effectively through the community, creating resilience through balanced sharing rather than accumulation or deprivation. This approach transforms economic relationships from competitive to cooperative, fostering both material and social wealth.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Yes - addresses universal resource distribution challenges
2. Depth preservation: Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding of economic harmony
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear manifestations and systemic applications
4. Individual-Universal connection: Yes - links personal practice to collective wellbeing
5. Developmental clarity: Yes - shows progression from basic sharing to systemic understanding
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - concrete expressions and outcomes identified

The universalization maintains the sophisticated economic philosophy of Rakirinakuy while making it accessible and applicable across cultural contexts. It preserves the deep understanding of collective prosperity while providing practical guidance for implementation.

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this universalization?
