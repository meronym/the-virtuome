Let me follow the analytical process step by step:

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
Core principle: Integration of conscious will and loving wisdom
Key functions:
- Directs intentional action through love
- Aligns personal will with universal creative force
- Transforms intention into ethical action
- Integrates heart wisdom with purposeful doing

Relationship patterns:
- Bridges personal intention and collective wellbeing 
- Connects spiritual understanding with practical action
- Integrates emotional wisdom with volitional power
- Links individual purpose with universal creative force

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING
Universal experiences:
- Motivated action guided by care/love
- Alignment of intention with higher purpose
- Integration of heart and will
- Conscious creative expression

Contemporary applications:
- Ethical leadership
- Authentic relationship building
- Purpose-driven action
- Conscious creation/work

Based on this analysis, here is the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The integration of conscious will with loving wisdom, manifesting as purposeful action aligned with life's creative force. It represents the capacity to direct one's power through the wisdom of the heart, transforming pure intention into ethical action that serves both individual purpose and collective flourishing.

[Essential Nature]
Conscious love-will represents the marriage of power and wisdom, intention and care, purpose and compassion. It manifests as the capacity to act from a place of integrated wisdom where doing flows from loving awareness rather than mere tactical thinking or blind emotion. This quality enables the transformation of raw creative force into ethical action through the alchemy of conscious care.

This power operates at the intersection of individual purpose and universal creativity, providing the bridge between personal agency and collective wellbeing. It manifests as the ability to remain heart-centered while exercising will, and will-focused while remaining heart-open.

[Manifestations]
- Clear intention married with genuine care in action
- Creative expression that serves both self-actualization and collective good
- Decision-making that integrates practical wisdom with ethical awareness
- Leadership that combines vision with compassion
- Relationships characterized by both purposeful engagement and authentic care
- Work/creation that expresses both personal truth and universal value

[Functional Description]
Conscious love-will develops through the progressive integration of power and wisdom, intention and care. It begins with the recognition that effective action requires both clear purpose and genuine care. As this understanding deepens, one learns to access and direct creative force through the lens of heart-wisdom, transforming raw potential into ethical manifestation. The quality grows through practical engagement with increasingly complex challenges that demand both strong will and deep compassion.

In daily life, this quality expresses as the capacity to remain purposeful without becoming harsh, and caring without becoming weak. It enables leadership that inspires rather than dominates, creativity that serves rather than exploits, and relationships that support mutual growth rather than mere exchange. This integration of love and will provides the foundation for action that is both personally fulfilling and collectively beneficial.

This universalized description:
1. Preserves the core spiritual-practical integration of the original concept
2. Makes it accessible through common human experiences
3. Maintains practical applicability
4. Links personal development with universal principles
5. Provides clear developmental trajectory
6. Offers observable manifestations
7. Retains philosophical sophistication while using phenomenological language

Would you like me to adjust any aspect of this universalization?
