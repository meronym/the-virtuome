Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Balance in resource and responsibility distribution
Key functions: 
- Maintains social harmony
- Ensures collective wellbeing
- Prevents resource concentration
- Builds community resilience

UNIVERSALIZATION:
Common human experiences:
- Sharing limited resources
- Managing collective needs
- Balancing individual/group interests
- Experiencing fairness/unfairness

Here's my attempt at the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to ensure fair and balanced distribution of resources, responsibilities, and opportunities within a community, guided by awareness of collective wellbeing and sustainable relationship patterns. This quality manifests as active participation in maintaining social equilibrium through conscious sharing and mutual support.

[Essential Nature]
Distributive justice operates as an integrative awareness that recognizes the interconnected nature of individual and collective flourishing. It embodies the understanding that true prosperity emerges from balanced exchange and mutual support rather than accumulation. This quality combines practical wisdom about resource management with deep insight into human interdependence and community sustainability.

At its core, it expresses the natural human capacity to recognize and maintain life-supporting patterns of exchange and reciprocity. Rather than being merely a social construct, it reflects fundamental patterns of balance observed in natural systems and human communities across cultures and times.

[Manifestations]
- Spontaneous recognition of opportunities to share resources and responsibilities
- Natural attention to patterns of need and abundance within a community
- Intuitive awareness of imbalances in distribution or contribution
- Active engagement in maintaining fair exchange systems
- Practical wisdom in managing collective resources sustainably
- Capacity to mediate competing needs and interests
- Development of systems that support balanced distribution

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through direct experience with sharing systems and their outcomes, gradually evolving from simple reciprocity to sophisticated understanding of community dynamics. It begins with personal experiences of fairness and unfairness, matures through participation in sharing practices, and culminates in deep insight into patterns of sustainable distribution. The development process integrates emotional intelligence, practical wisdom, and systems understanding.

In practice, distributive justice manifests as both reactive and proactive engagement with community needs. It enables individuals to participate effectively in sharing systems, contribute appropriately to collective needs, and help maintain sustainable patterns of exchange. This quality supports both immediate fair distribution and long-term community resilience, adapting to changing circumstances while maintaining core principles of balance and mutual support.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: The description focuses on universal human experiences of sharing and balance
2. Depth preservation: Maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible
3. Practical applicability: Includes clear manifestations and developmental aspects
4. Individual-universal connection: Links personal development to community patterns
5. Developmental clarity: Shows progression from simple to complex understanding
6. Observable manifestations: Listed in concrete, verifiable terms

Would you like me to:
1. Adjust any aspect for greater clarity or precision?
2. Expand on the developmental process?
3. Add more practical examples?
4. Strengthen any particular dimension?
