Let me work through this systematically.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Forest Wisdom:
Core principle: Deep systemic understanding through immersive relationship
Key functions: Navigation, prediction, sustainability, knowledge integration
Relationship patterns: Multi-level awareness, cyclical understanding
Developmental aspects: Experiential learning, mentorship, pattern recognition

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Pattern recognition in complex systems
- Relationship-based understanding
- Experiential knowledge development
- Integration of practical and intuitive knowing

Here's my attempt at the universal reformulation:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
Systemic Intelligence is the capacity to understand, navigate, and harmonize with complex living systems through direct experience, pattern recognition, and integrative awareness. It combines careful observation, practical interaction, and intuitive comprehension to develop deep, action-guiding understanding of interconnected relationships.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the mind's natural ability to comprehend complex systems through immersive relationship rather than abstract analysis. It develops through sustained attention to patterns, cycles, and interconnections, creating a dynamic understanding that combines practical knowledge with intuitive insight. Unlike purely analytical understanding, systemic intelligence emerges from direct engagement and grows through iterative interaction with living systems, whether natural or social.

The intelligence manifests as an ever-deepening capacity to perceive relationships, anticipate changes, and respond appropriately to systemic dynamics. It integrates observable patterns with subtle cues, combining empirical observation with pattern-based intuition to generate practical wisdom.

[Manifestations]
- Recognition of subtle patterns and emerging changes within complex systems
- Ability to anticipate systemic responses and cascade effects
- Integration of multiple levels of observation into coherent understanding
- Development of appropriate response patterns based on systemic awareness
- Capacity to communicate system dynamics through practical guidance
- Growing attunement to feedback loops and cyclic patterns
- Cultivation of sustainable relationship patterns within systems

[Functional Description]
Systemic Intelligence develops through sustained engagement with complex systems, beginning with careful observation and gradually incorporating multiple layers of understanding. As experience accumulates, pattern recognition becomes increasingly intuitive, allowing rapid assessment of system states and likely developments. This understanding builds through cycles of observation, interaction, and reflection, creating an ever-more-sophisticated mental model of system dynamics.

In practice, this quality enables effective navigation of complex situations, informed decision-making in uncertain conditions, and sustainable relationship building within systems. It manifests as both practical capability and intuitive understanding, guiding actions that maintain system health while achieving necessary outcomes. This intelligence particularly shines in situations requiring long-term sustainability, careful resource management, or navigation of complex relationships.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Yes - based on universal human capacity for pattern recognition and relationship building
2. Depth preservation: Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding while making it accessible
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear pathways for development and application
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - links personal development to universal principles
5. Development clarity: Yes - progression from observation to intuitive understanding clearly outlined
