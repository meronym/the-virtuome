Let me work through this systematically.

1. INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS of Ixtlamachiliztli:
Core principle: Integration of knowledge with direct experience
Key functions: 
- Bridging theoretical and practical knowledge
- Developing situational judgment
- Cultivating experiential wisdom
- Enabling effective action
Systemic role: Links personal development, social effectiveness, and cosmic understanding

2. UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Learning through experience
- Developing good judgment
- Growing wisdom through practice
- Integrating knowledge types
Contemporary parallels:
- Practical wisdom
- Experiential learning
- Embodied knowledge
- Professional expertise development

Here's the universalized description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to integrate knowledge, experience, and judgment into a unified understanding that enables effective action. It represents the marriage of theoretical comprehension with practical wisdom, developing through direct engagement with life while being informed by deeper principles and patterns.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the maturation of knowledge into wisdom through the crucible of experience. It differs from pure intellectual understanding or mere practical skill by embodying a dynamic integration of multiple ways of knowing: theoretical comprehension, experiential learning, pattern recognition, and intuitive grasp. This integration enables one to perceive situations clearly, understand their deeper nature, and respond with appropriate action.

Unlike static knowledge or mechanical skill, this quality continues to deepen through engagement with increasingly complex situations, developing greater subtlety and nuance while maintaining practical effectiveness. It represents the bridge between knowing and doing, between understanding and action, between principle and practice.

[Manifestations]
- Ability to recognize patterns and principles in novel situations
- Natural integration of knowledge into action without hesitation
- Capacity to teach others through both explanation and demonstration
- Balanced judgment that considers multiple perspectives and contexts
- Recognition of deeper principles within practical circumstances
- Ability to adapt knowledge to changing situations
- Development of intuitive expertise that remains grounded in principle

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a spiral process of learning, application, reflection, and integration. Each experience becomes a foundation for deeper understanding, while each new understanding illuminates future experiences. The development begins with basic pattern recognition and rule-following, progresses through increasingly nuanced understanding of contexts and exceptions, and culminates in an intuitive grasp that transcends yet includes formal knowledge.

In practice, this manifests as the ability to navigate complex situations with both precision and flexibility. It enables one to respond appropriately to novel challenges, teach others effectively, and continue learning from every experience. This quality bridges the gap between theory and practice, allowing wisdom to flow naturally into action while maintaining awareness of underlying principles. It represents the maturation of knowledge into wisdom through the integration of understanding with experience.

This universalization maintains the sophisticated integration of knowledge types central to ixtlamachiliztli while making it accessible through common human experiences of learning and development. It preserves the dynamic nature of the concept while expressing it in phenomenological rather than culture-specific terms.

Verification:
1. Cross-cultural meaning: Yes - focuses on universal human experiences of learning and development
2. Preserves depth: Yes - maintains sophisticated understanding of knowledge integration
3. Practical applicability: Yes - clear connection to action and development
4. Individual-universal connection: Yes - links personal development to universal patterns
5. Development clarity: Yes - describes progressive spiral of learning and integration
6. Observable manifestations: Yes - listed manifestations are concrete and verifiable
