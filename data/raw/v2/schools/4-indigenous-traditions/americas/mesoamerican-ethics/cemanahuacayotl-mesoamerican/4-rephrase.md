Let me analyze Cemanahuacayotl systematically before composing the universal description.

INITIAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS:
Core principle: Universal interconnection and resultant responsibility
Key functions:
- Recognition of cosmic relationships
- Environmental stewardship
- Intergenerational duty
- Ritual maintenance
- Collective consciousness

UNIVERSALIZATION MAPPING:
Universal experiences:
- Sense of connection to nature
- Recognition of interdependence
- Feeling of cosmic significance
- Awareness of collective impact
- Multigenerational perspective

Contemporary parallels:
- Environmental consciousness
- Systems thinking
- Global citizenship
- Ecological responsibility
- Sustainable development

Here's the universal language description:

```markdown
[Core Definition]
The capacity to perceive, understand, and actively maintain the web of relationships that sustains life and meaning across all scales - from immediate surroundings to cosmic order. This awareness manifests as a deep sense of responsibility for maintaining harmony and balance in both natural and social systems.

[Essential Nature]
This quality emerges from the direct recognition that existence is inherently interconnected, where every action ripples through multiple layers of reality. It combines keen awareness with active responsibility, moving beyond mere understanding to engaged stewardship. Rather than being an imposed duty, it flows naturally from the experiential recognition of one's place within larger systems of meaning and life.

This recognition develops through progressively wider circles of awareness and care, from immediate relationships to global systems to cosmic order. As this awareness deepens, it naturally evokes corresponding levels of responsible action and careful consideration of long-term impacts.

[Manifestations]
- Careful consideration of environmental impact in daily choices
- Natural tendency to consider future generations in decision-making
- Active participation in maintaining community and cultural traditions
- Spontaneous recognition of patterns and connections across different scales
- Regular practices that acknowledge and strengthen relationship with nature
- Development of increasingly subtle awareness of systemic impacts
- Integration of personal actions with larger purposes and meanings

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interplay between expanding awareness and deepening responsibility. As perception of interconnection grows, it naturally awakens care and concern at corresponding levels. This awakening then motivates actions that maintain harmony and balance, which in turn enhance awareness further. This creates a positive feedback loop of growing understanding and increasingly skilled action.

In practical terms, this manifests as an organic integration of personal and collective wellbeing. Daily choices naturally consider wider impacts, not from rule-following but from direct recognition of relationship. This leads to spontaneous care for environment, community, and future generations, expressed through both practical actions and ritual/symbolic acknowledgment of deeper connections.

VERIFICATION:
1. Cross-cultural meaning? ✓ Uses universal human experiences of connection and responsibility
2. Preserves depth? ✓ Maintains sophistication while making accessible
3. Practically applicable? ✓ Clear manifestations and development path
4. Individual-universal connection? ✓ Shows progression from personal to cosmic
5. Development clear? ✓ Describes growth process and feedback loops
6. Observable manifestations? ✓ Concrete behavioral indicators included

Would you like me to refine any particular aspect of this description?
