[Core Definition]
The quality of being fundamentally true to oneself while maintaining deep alignment with reality. It manifests as an integrated authenticity that connects personal truth with universal principles, expressing itself through consistent thought, speech, and action that emerges from one's genuine center.

[Essential Nature]
Rootedness represents the human capacity to establish and maintain authentic connection with both inner truth and outer reality. Like a tree whose roots simultaneously anchor it and enable growth, this quality provides stable foundation while facilitating development. It operates through continuous alignment between internal experience and external expression, personal understanding and universal principles.

This quality transcends simple honesty or truthfulness, encompassing instead a fundamental congruence between being and action, essence and expression, individual and universal. It requires both deep self-knowledge and clear perception of reality, combining personal integrity with cosmic alignment.

[Manifestations]
- Speech and action that consistently reflect genuine inner reality
- Stable presence that remains authentic under pressure
- Natural authority that emerges from deep alignment rather than position
- Ability to recognize and respond to truth in others
- Integration of personal insight with universal principles
- Grounded wisdom that combines practicality with depth
- Authentic leadership that inspires through genuine presence

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive integration of inner experience with outer expression, personal truth with universal principles. It begins with basic honesty and self-awareness, deepens through conscious alignment of thought, speech, and action, and matures into a natural authenticity that seamlessly connects individual truth with universal reality. The process requires both careful self-observation and active engagement with reality's deeper patterns.

In practical terms, it manifests as a compelling presence that naturally commands respect through its genuine authority rather than imposed power. People with this quality exhibit remarkable consistency across contexts, maintain stability during challenges, and demonstrate wisdom that emerges from deeply integrated experience rather than accumulated knowledge. Their actions carry particular weight because they emerge from authentic understanding rather than mere convention or calculation.
