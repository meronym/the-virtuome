[Core Definition]
The capacity to responsibly hold, protect, and transmit important knowledge while understanding its proper context, timing, and appropriate recipients. This includes discerning what should be shared, when, and with whom, while maintaining the integrity and depth of the knowledge through its transmission.

[Essential Nature]
Wise stewardship of knowledge transcends mere information retention or sharing. It represents a deep understanding of how knowledge lives and moves through human communities, requiring careful discernment of readiness, context, and appropriate transmission methods. This quality combines protective guardianship with skillful sharing, recognizing that some knowledge carries responsibilities and requires proper preparation to receive and handle appropriately.

This stewardship includes understanding the ripple effects of knowledge transmission, the importance of timing and readiness, and the responsibility to maintain knowledge's integrity while ensuring its survival through appropriate sharing. It acknowledges that certain knowledge can transform, empower, or potentially harm depending on how it is handled and shared.

[Manifestations]
- Careful discernment in sharing sensitive information
- Progressive revelation based on others' readiness and need
- Maintenance of knowledge integrity across transmissions
- Protection of profound insights from misuse or dilution
- Recognition of appropriate timing and context for sharing
- Development of others' capacity to receive and hold knowledge
- Active preservation of essential wisdom through proper channels

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a combination of protective and transmissive capacities, constantly evaluating context, readiness, and appropriate methods of sharing. It requires developing acute sensitivity to others' preparedness and the potential impacts of knowledge, while maintaining a clear understanding of proper timing and appropriate forms of transmission. The steward must balance preservation with necessary sharing, ensuring knowledge remains alive and relevant while protecting its essential nature.

In practice, this manifests as a careful approach to teaching and sharing, where information is revealed progressively as understanding develops. It involves creating appropriate conditions for knowledge transmission, recognizing when others are ready to receive certain insights, and maintaining the integrity of knowledge through its movement between people and across time. This quality enables both the preservation of deep wisdom and its continued relevance through appropriate adaptation to new contexts.
