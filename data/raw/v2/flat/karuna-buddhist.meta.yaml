title: Karuṇā (करुणा) - Compassion
definition: Karuṇā represents the wish to remove suffering from all beings, coupled
  with active engagement in alleviating that suffering. In Mahayana Buddhism, it becomes
  mahākaruṇā (great compassion), a defining quality of bodhisattvas.
key_aspects:
- Recognition of suffering
- Genuine concern for others
- Active engagement in helping
- Non-discriminative application
- Freedom from pity or condescension
historical_development: Present in early Buddhism as one of the four Brahmaviharas,
  later elevated in Mahayana Buddhism as essential to the bodhisattva path alongside
  wisdom (prajñā).
contemporary_relevance: Central to Buddhist-inspired approaches to psychology, healthcare,
  social work, and conflict resolution. Basis for contemplative practice in secular
  contexts.
