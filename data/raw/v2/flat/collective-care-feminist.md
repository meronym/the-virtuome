[Core Definition]
The capacity to create, maintain, and participate in networks of mutual support that distribute care responsibilities across communities, ensuring collective wellbeing through shared responsibility and reciprocal attention to needs, while building sustainable systems of support that transcend individual relationships.

[Essential Nature]
Collective care emerges from the recognition that human wellbeing is inherently interconnected and that sustainable support requires coordinated effort beyond individual relationships. It manifests as both an awareness of shared responsibility and the practical creation of care infrastructure. This quality operates at the intersection of personal capability and social organization, transforming individual acts of care into sustainable patterns of mutual support.

Unlike simple helping behaviors, collective care involves the conscious development of systems and practices that distribute care responsibilities across networks of relationships, preventing burnout while ensuring more reliable and comprehensive support for all members of a community.

[Functional Description]
Collective care operates through the intentional development of support networks and care practices that extend beyond immediate relationships. It involves identifying community needs, organizing resources and capabilities, and creating sustainable systems for mutual support. This quality develops through growing awareness of interdependence, practical experience in care coordination, and the cultivation of trust networks that can sustain long-term mutual support.

In practice, collective care manifests as organized systems of mutual aid, shared responsibility for community wellbeing, and coordinated responses to individual and collective challenges. It creates resilient support networks that can respond to varying needs while preventing caregiver burnout through the distribution of responsibilities. This approach transforms individual acts of care into sustainable patterns of community support, building lasting infrastructure for collective wellbeing.
