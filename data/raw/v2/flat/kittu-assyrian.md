[Core Definition]
The fundamental capacity to recognize, align with, and manifest truth and rightness in thought, speech, and action. It combines clear perception of what is with the active commitment to bring human affairs into harmony with deeper principles of order and fairness.

[Essential Nature]
Truth-justice represents the human faculty for discerning and implementing natural order in social reality. It operates simultaneously as an perceptive capacity (recognizing what is true), an ethical compass (distinguishing right action), and an executive force (implementing fair solutions). This quality bridges individual conscience with universal principles, manifesting as both personal integrity and social justice.

Beyond mere factual accuracy or rule-following, it embodies the active alignment of human affairs with deeper patterns of cosmic order. It requires both clear seeing and courageous action, combining wisdom with practical implementation.

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of perception and action. It begins with basic truth-telling and fair dealing, evolves through increasingly subtle discrimination of right action, and matures into natural alignment with universal principles. The journey involves facing personal biases, resisting expedient compromises, and developing courage to uphold truth despite challenges.

In practice, it manifests as trustworthy character, clear judgment, and the capacity to create order from chaos. It enables leadership that inspires trust, decision-making that stands the test of time, and the ability to resolve conflicts through higher principles rather than mere compromise. Those embodying this quality naturally become reference points for others, creating ripples of truth and fairness in their sphere of influence.
