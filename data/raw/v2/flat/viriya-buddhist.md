[Core Definition]
The capacity for sustained, intelligent engagement that combines enthusiasm with persistence. It manifests as the ability to maintain consistent effort toward worthy aims while skillfully managing one's energy and avoiding both over-exertion and complacency.

[Essential Nature]
Sustained engagement represents a dynamic balance between active force and intelligent restraint. Unlike mere persistence or raw determination, it embodies a sophisticated understanding of effort that recognizes the importance of rhythm, sustainability, and appropriate application of energy. It combines the warmth of enthusiasm with the stability of commitment, operating through both active phases of intense engagement and receptive phases of restoration and integration.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent application of effort despite obstacles or fluctuating conditions
- Natural enthusiasm that refreshes itself through engaged activity
- Skillful alternation between intensity and recovery
- Capacity to maintain long-term commitments without burnout
- Ability to adjust effort according to circumstances while maintaining direction
- Development of momentum that becomes increasingly self-sustaining
- Integration of activity and rest into a sustainable rhythm

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by establishing a dynamic equilibrium between opposing forces: effort and ease, engagement and recovery, persistence and flexibility. It develops through progressive refinement of one's relationship with effort, moving from crude pushing to sophisticated engagement. The initial stages often require conscious application of force, but with maturation, it evolves toward a more natural, self-sustaining momentum.

In practical expression, it manifests as the ability to stay committed to long-term goals while maintaining freshness and enthusiasm. It enables both the intensity needed for breakthrough moments and the consistency required for lasting change. This quality transforms the experience of effort from one of strain and struggle to one of engaged flow, where persistence becomes natural and sustainable rather than forced.
