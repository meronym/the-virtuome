[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize shared challenges and create sustained networks of mutual support and coordinated action, building collective strength while honoring diversity. It manifests as both practical cooperation and deep recognition of interconnected wellbeing, enabling groups to face challenges through unified response while maintaining distinctive identities.

[Essential Nature]
This quality emerges from the recognition that human challenges and aspirations often transcend individual or group boundaries, requiring coordinated response for effective address. It represents the evolution from isolated struggle to networked resilience, combining practical resource-sharing with deeper recognition of shared destiny. The quality manifests through both immediate mutual aid and long-term strategic collaboration, creating durable support systems that strengthen all participants while preserving their autonomy and unique characteristics.

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through progressive expansion of concern and capability, moving from recognition of shared challenges to active creation of support networks. It develops through practical experiences of mutual aid, growing from immediate response to sustained collaboration. The process builds both practical skills in coordination and deeper understanding of interconnected wellbeing.

In practice, it enables groups to face challenges that exceed individual capacity, creating resilient networks that enhance collective capability while preserving individual strength. These networks become self-reinforcing systems that generate both practical solutions and new forms of collaboration, leading to increased collective resilience and capability for addressing complex challenges.
