[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, establish, and maintain right relationship between parts within any whole system, manifesting as the intuitive recognition of fairness, the practical ability to balance competing interests, and the active maintenance of proportional exchange between entities.

[Essential Nature]
Justice operates as a fundamental ordering principle in human consciousness and social systems, expressing itself through both intuitive recognition of balance/imbalance and developed capacity for ethical reasoning. It functions simultaneously as an internal compass for individual conduct and an external framework for collective organization.

This quality emerges from the basic human capacity to perceive proportionality and fairness, developing through increasingly sophisticated understanding of relationship, responsibility, and reciprocity. It serves as both a regulatory mechanism for social harmony and a developmental driver for ethical consciousness.

[Functional Description]
Justice operates through a dynamic interplay between intuitive recognition and developed judgment. The innate human capacity to perceive proportionality and fairness provides immediate guidance in simple situations, while developed ethical reasoning enables navigation of complex moral landscapes. This quality grows through exposure to increasingly complex situations requiring balance, developing from basic fairness recognition to sophisticated ethical understanding.

In practical expression, justice manifests as the active maintenance of right relationship in all spheres of life. It operates as an internal guide for personal conduct, a framework for interpersonal interactions, and a organizing principle for collective systems. The quality develops through conscious practice in balancing competing interests, making fair decisions, and maintaining equitable relationships, supported by reflection on outcomes and continuous refinement of judgment.
