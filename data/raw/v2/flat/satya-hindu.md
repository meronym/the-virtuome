[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, align with, and express reality as it is, manifesting as consistency between perception, understanding, and action. This quality enables direct engagement with truth at all levels - from factual accuracy to ultimate reality - while fostering integrity in thought, speech, and behavior.

[Essential Nature]
Truth-alignment operates as both a perceptual capacity and an expressive force, enabling clear recognition of what is while simultaneously fostering authentic manifestation of that recognition. It functions as a natural harmonizer between inner and outer reality, creating coherence between understanding and expression, intention and action, perception and response.

This quality serves as a fundamental ordering principle in human experience, establishing reliable relationships between knowledge and action, individual and community, apparent and ultimate reality. It develops through progressive refinement of perception, deepening of understanding, and increasing authenticity of expression.

[Manifestations]
- Accurate perception and description of reality as experienced
- Authentic self-expression and consistent behavior
- Natural alignment between thoughts, words, and actions
- Growing capacity to distinguish real from apparent
- Progressive revelation of deeper truths through lived experience
- Increasing harmony between individual understanding and universal principles

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dual process of clarification and integration. The clarifying aspect progressively removes distortions in perception and expression, while the integrative aspect creates increasing coherence between different levels of experience - from sensory to intellectual to intuitive understanding. This natural movement toward truth creates expanding circles of harmony between personal insight and universal reality.

In practical terms, this quality manifests as growing trustworthiness, clearer understanding, and more authentic expression. It enables both precise discernment in specific situations and deepening wisdom about life's fundamental nature. Regular expression of this quality builds reliable character, fosters genuine relationships, and creates natural alignment between individual development and universal principles.
