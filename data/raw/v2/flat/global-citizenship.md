[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive expansion of identity and care, beginning with direct experience of human commonality across cultural boundaries.

This evolution leads to increasingly skillful navigation between local and global contexts, supported by growing capacity to hold multiple perspectives simultaneously.

In practical expression, global citizenship manifests as natural consideration of broader impacts in daily decisions, spontaneous recognition of human commonality across differences, and authentic engagement with both local and global challenges. It enables effective cross-cultural collaboration while maintaining deep respect for diversity, expressing as practical wisdom in navigating our interconnected world.
