[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize, be moved by, and respond wisely to suffering in oneself and others. It combines emotional sensitivity with practical wisdom, manifesting as the natural impulse to alleviate distress joined with the discernment to act effectively and sustainably.

[Essential Nature]
Compassion emerges from the recognition of our shared vulnerability and fundamental interconnectedness. It operates as an integration of heart and mind: the heart's natural resonance with suffering combines with the mind's capacity for understanding and skillful response. Unlike mere emotional empathy, it includes the wisdom component that enables effective action without becoming overwhelmed. This quality develops from personal to universal scope, gradually expanding its radius of concern while maintaining practical effectiveness.

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dynamic interaction between emotional resonance and practical wisdom. The emotional component provides the motivation and energy for response, while the wisdom aspect ensures effectiveness and sustainability. It develops through progressive challenges that strengthen both the capacity to stay present with suffering and the ability to respond skillfully.

In practice, it manifests as a natural, spontaneous response to suffering combined with intelligent discernment about appropriate action. This creates a sustainable way of engaging with others' difficulties that neither walls off emotional sensitivity nor becomes overwhelmed by it. The result is effective care that benefits both giver and receiver while expanding one's sphere of concern and capability.
