[Core Definition]
The capacity of groups to access, generate and embody intelligence beyond individual limitations through conscious interaction and shared presence. This manifests as enhanced understanding, coordinated action, and emergent wisdom that transcends while including individual contributions.

[Essential Nature]
Collective Intelligence emerges when individuals align their awareness and capabilities in service of shared understanding and purpose. It operates as a dynamic field phenomenon where the quality of collective attention, relationship, and intention creates conditions for enhanced perception, processing, and action. This intelligence isn't merely aggregative but generative â€“ producing insights, possibilities, and capacities unavailable to individuals alone.

The phenomenon requires both individual development (capacity for presence, listening, contribution) and group development (trust, coherence, shared practices). It manifests through tangible shifts in group capability, understanding, and effectiveness while remaining irreducible to any single factor or participant.

[Manifestations]
- Enhanced problem-solving and innovation through genuine dialogue and shared exploration
- Spontaneous coordination and coherence in group action without central control
- Emergence of insights and understanding beyond any individual's knowledge
- Development of shared mental models and understanding that improve group function
- Increased capacity to hold and work with complexity and multiple perspectives
- Observable field effects: shared resonance, coherent energy, group flow states
- Practical outcomes exceeding the sum of individual capabilities

[Functional Description]
Collective Intelligence operates through the interaction of multiple factors: quality of presence, relationship patterns, communication dynamics, and shared practices. The foundation is individual capacity for presence and contribution combined with group capacity for coherence and integration. As these elements align, new capabilities emerge through resonance, synchronization, and mutual enhancement of individual faculties.

In practice, this manifests as improved group performance across multiple dimensions: better decisions, more innovative solutions, enhanced coordination, and deeper shared understanding. Groups develop specific markers: fluid leadership, natural role distribution, rapid learning, and effective integration of diverse perspectives. The quality becomes self-reinforcing as groups learn to consciously cultivate and maintain conditions that support its emergence.
