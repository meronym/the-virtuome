[Core Definition]
The capacity to perceive, acknowledge, and align with reality at all levels - factual, personal, and universal. It manifests as clear seeing, honest expression, and faithful action that bridges inner recognition with outer manifestation, creating coherence between understanding and behavior.

[Essential Nature]
Truth-alignment is both a perceptual capacity and an active force, operating as an internal compass that orients awareness toward what is real and guides action toward authentic expression. It functions simultaneously as a receptive quality that allows reality to be seen clearly and a generative quality that produces faithful representation and honest engagement.

This quality serves as a fundamental bridge between inner and outer worlds, ensuring that perception, understanding, communication, and action form a coherent whole. It requires both courage to face what is and integrity to represent it faithfully, creating trustworthy connections between self, others, and reality itself.

[Manifestations]
- Clear recognition of what is present and real in any situation
- Honest and accurate communication that faithfully represents reality
- Alignment between inner understanding and outer expression
- Authentic behavior that matches stated principles and values
- Active seeking of deeper understanding beyond surface appearances
- Reliable fulfillment of commitments and promises
- Integration of thought, word, and action into coherent whole

[Functional Description]
Truth-alignment operates through a dynamic interplay of receptive awareness and active expression. It begins with the willingness to see clearly, develops through careful attention to accuracy in thought and communication, and matures into a comprehensive integrity that coordinates understanding, expression, and action. This quality grows through repeated cycles of observation, verification, and faithful representation, gradually building trust in one's capacity to recognize and convey truth.

In practical terms, this quality enables reliable judgment, trustworthy relationships, and effective action based on accurate understanding. It creates the conditions for genuine learning, meaningful communication, and authentic connection with others. When fully developed, it produces a natural authority that comes from consistent alignment with reality, making one a reliable source of understanding and a trustworthy presence in any situation.
