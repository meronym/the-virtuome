[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain an active learning stance throughout life, characterized by persistent receptivity to new understanding and willingness to grow through experience. This quality combines intellectual humility with developmental courage, enabling continuous personal evolution through conscious engagement with life's teachings.

[Essential Nature]
Learning-receptivity represents a fundamental orientation toward growth that transcends specific knowledge acquisition. It manifests as an ever-present readiness to recognize learning opportunities in all experiences, combined with the humility to acknowledge one's ongoing development. This quality differs from mere studiousness or curiosity in that it represents a comprehensive life stance that integrates intellectual, emotional, and practical learning into a unified approach to personal development.

The essence of this quality lies in maintaining the beneficial attributes of a beginner's mind - openness, enthusiasm, and humility - while accumulating expertise and wisdom. It creates a dynamic balance between knowledge acquisition and openness to new understanding, preventing both stagnation and superficiality.

[Manifestations]
- Maintaining genuine curiosity and openness despite expertise
- Regular identification of learning opportunities in daily experiences
- Active seeking of feedback and new perspectives
- Willing engagement with challenging ideas or situations
- Integration of new insights with existing understanding
- Balanced confidence that neither impedes nor depends on learning
- Consistent application of lessons learned to future situations

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a dual process of active receptivity and integrated application. The receptive aspect maintains continuous awareness of learning opportunities while suppressing defensive or assumptive responses that might block new understanding. Simultaneously, an active integration process connects new insights to existing knowledge and practical application, creating an expanding spiral of development rather than mere accumulation of information.

In practice, this manifests as a distinctive combination of humility and initiative in learning situations. Whether in formal education, professional development, or personal growth, individuals expressing this quality consistently demonstrate openness to new understanding while actively engaging with and applying what they learn. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where learning effectiveness increases over time while maintaining freshness of perspective.
