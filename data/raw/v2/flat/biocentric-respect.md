[Core Definition]
The capacity to recognize and honor the inherent worth of all living beings, manifesting as an expanded sphere of care and consideration beyond human concerns. This quality enables direct recognition of life's fundamental value and guides harmonious interaction with the living world.

[Essential Nature]
Life-respect emerges from direct recognition of the phenomenon of life itself - the shared quality of being that animates all living creatures. It manifests as an immediate, intuitive sense of life's inherent value, independent of its utility or relationship to human purposes. This recognition naturally expands our sphere of moral consideration and care beyond purely human concerns.

This quality combines cognitive recognition of life's complexity and interconnection with emotional resonance and practical care. It develops through direct experience with other life forms, deepening understanding of shared existence, and growing awareness of life's diverse manifestations.

[Manifestations]
- Immediate recognition of other beings as subjects rather than objects
- Spontaneous care and consideration for other life forms
- Careful attention to impact on other living beings
- Natural restraint in actions that might harm life
- Integration of other beings' needs in decision-making
- Active protection and support of life's flourishing
- Recognition of and respect for each species' unique way of being

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through direct experiential recognition rather than abstract reasoning. When encountered, other living beings are immediately perceived as centers of experience and value rather than mere resources or background elements. This recognition triggers both cognitive appreciation of life's complexity and emotional resonance with other beings' existence, naturally expanding our sphere of practical care and consideration.

In practice, life-respect shapes behavior through both restraint and active care. It manifests as careful consideration before actions that might impact other beings, positive efforts to support life's flourishing, and practical integration of other beings' needs in human activities. This quality develops through direct experience with nature, growing understanding of life's interconnection, and practiced attention to other beings' ways of existing.
