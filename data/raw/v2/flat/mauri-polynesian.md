[Core Definition]
The fundamental animating force that manifests as vitality, wholeness, and interconnected aliveness in all things. It represents the observable quality of health and vigor that can be sensed in thriving beings, places, and systems, serving as both an indicator of wellbeing and a force that can be actively cultivated and maintained.

[Essential Nature]
Vitality-force represents the observable phenomenon of alive wholeness that manifests across multiple scales - from individual beings to entire ecosystems. It operates as both an inherent quality and a dynamic force that can be strengthened or diminished through interaction and care. This force becomes apparent through its effects: the degree of thriving, resilience, and harmonious interconnection present in any living system.

Unlike abstract concepts, vitality-force can be directly sensed as the tangible quality of vibrant aliveness present in healthy beings and environments. It manifests as both a state and a process - the current condition of wholeness and the ongoing maintenance of life-supporting relationships.

[Manifestations]
- Physical vitality expressed through health, energy and resilience
- Environmental wholeness visible in thriving, balanced ecosystems
- Social vitality present in harmonious, generative relationships
- Personal vitality felt as wellbeing, presence and engagement
- Systemic vitality observed in sustainable, regenerative patterns
- Developmental vitality seen in healthy growth and adaptation

[Functional Description]
Vitality-force operates through networks of life-supporting relationships, where the wellbeing of each part contributes to and draws from the wholeness of the system. It can be diminished through disconnection, exploitation or disharmony, and strengthened through conscious care, balanced exchange, and the maintenance of regenerative patterns. This force is not simply present or absent, but exists on a spectrum that can be actively influenced through awareness and engagement.

The practical expression of vitality-force becomes visible through intentional cultivation and stewardship. This involves maintaining awareness of interconnected impacts, making choices that support systemic health, and actively participating in regenerative relationships. Success manifests as increased resilience, sustainable thriving, and the tangible sense of vibrant aliveness that characterizes healthy systems at all scales.
