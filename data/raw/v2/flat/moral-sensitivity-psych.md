[Core Definition]
The innate human capacity to recognize and feel the moral dimension of experience - the ability to sense when situations involve harm, fairness, loyalty, authority, or sacred values, combined with the awareness of how actions and choices affect others' wellbeing.

[Essential Nature]
Moral sensitivity operates as a fundamental human capacity that bridges our emotional and cognitive systems, allowing us to detect and interpret the ethical dimensions present in our experiences and relationships. Like physical sensitivity allows us to navigate the material world, moral sensitivity enables navigation of the ethical landscape of human interaction and choice.

This capacity combines immediate intuitive recognition with deeper reflective awareness, operating through both feeling and understanding. It serves as the foundation for moral development and ethical behavior by alerting us to situations requiring moral consideration and enabling us to recognize the impact of our choices on others.

[Manifestations]
- Immediate recognition of potential harm or unfairness
- Heightened awareness of others' emotional states and needs
- Natural attunement to relationship dynamics and social obligations
- Spontaneous recognition of ethical dimensions in situations
- Progressive refinement of moral perception through experience
- Development from basic emotional recognition to nuanced ethical discernment
- Integration of intuitive feeling with reflective understanding

[Functional Description]
Moral sensitivity functions through an integrated system of emotional, intuitive, and cognitive processes. The initial response often comes as a felt sense - a gut feeling that something requires moral attention - followed by more conscious recognition and interpretation. This capacity develops through experience, becoming more refined and nuanced over time as we encounter diverse ethical situations and reflect on their implications.

In practice, moral sensitivity manifests as an ongoing awareness that informs our interactions and decisions. It operates as an early warning system for ethical concerns, alerts us to others' needs and feelings, and helps us recognize the broader implications of our choices. This awareness creates the foundation for moral reasoning, ethical decision-making, and compassionate action by ensuring we notice and respond to the moral dimensions of life.
