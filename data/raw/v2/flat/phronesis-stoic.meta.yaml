title: Phronēsis (φρόνησις) - Practical Wisdom
definition: In Stoic philosophy, phronēsis represents the fundamental capacity for
  practical reason and moral judgment, enabling one to discern the right course of
  action in any situation.
key_aspects:
- Discernment between what is and isn't in our control
- Correct judgment of impressions
- Application of reason to practical situations
- Understanding of natural law and cosmic order
- Integration of theoretical knowledge with practical action
historical_development: While rooted in earlier Greek philosophy, Stoic phronēsis
  emphasized practical application and moral development more than theoretical knowledge.
  Later Roman Stoics particularly stressed its role in daily decision-making.

  therapy, and leadership development. Essential for ethical reasoning in complex
  situations.
