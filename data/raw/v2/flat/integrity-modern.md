[Core Definition]
The quality of maintaining consistent alignment between one's inner values and outer actions, creating a coherent and reliable character that remains stable across contexts while adapting appropriately to circumstances. It manifests as the experienced sense of wholeness in one's ethical life and authentic self-expression.

[Essential Nature]
Integrity functions as an integrative force in human character, continuously harmonizing various aspects of the self - thoughts, feelings, words, and actions - into a coherent whole. Unlike rigid adherence to rules, it represents a dynamic stability that maintains ethical consistency while responding intelligently to context. This quality operates through an inner sense of coherence that guides behavior and decisions, much like how a well-tuned instrument maintains its essential tone across different pieces of music.

The development of integrity involves progressive integration of experience, understanding, and action, leading to increasingly reliable alignment between inner principles and outer behavior. This process builds both internal stability and external trustworthiness, creating a foundation for authentic relationships and sustained ethical action.

[Manifestations]
- Consistent alignment between stated values and observable actions
- Maintenance of ethical principles under pressure or when unobserved
- Natural congruence between inner experience and outer expression
- Reliable follow-through on commitments and responsibilities
- Appropriate transparency in relationships and communications
- Capacity to maintain ethical coherence across different contexts
- Integration of new experiences and learning without losing core stability

[Functional Description]
Integrity operates through a continuous internal feedback loop between ethical awareness, emotional attunement, and behavioral choice. This mechanism constantly monitors alignment between values and actions, generating both subtle and strong signals when misalignment occurs. Like a self-correcting compass, it helps navigate complex situations while maintaining true to one's essential direction, allowing for tactical flexibility while preserving strategic consistency.

In practice, integrity manifests as a natural authenticity that others experience as trustworthiness and reliability. It enables clear and consistent responses to challenges without rigid inflexibility. This quality develops through conscious practice in small daily choices, gradually building into a stable character trait that operates automatically in most situations while remaining consciously accessible for complex ethical decisions.
