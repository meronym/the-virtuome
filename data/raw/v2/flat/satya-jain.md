[Core Definition]
The quality of inner and outer alignment - maintaining harmony between understanding, expression, and action. It manifests as the capacity to perceive clearly, communicate authentically, and act with integrity, while remaining sensitive to the impact of truth on others.

[Essential Nature]
Truth as a quality of consciousness extends beyond mere factual accuracy or honest speech. It represents a state of fundamental alignment where perception, understanding, expression, and action form a seamless whole. This alignment creates clarity in both the internal and external dimensions of experience.

This quality develops through progressive refinement of perception, dissolution of self-deception, and cultivation of precise expression. It requires both courage to face reality and wisdom to express truth skillfully, especially when dealing with complex situations where multiple valid perspectives exist.

[Manifestations]
- Clear perception: Seeing reality without distortion from preferences or aversions
- Internal coherence: Alignment between thoughts, words, and actions
- Authentic expression: Communication that accurately reflects understanding
- Skillful truth-telling: Considering timing, context, and impact
- Depth of understanding: Recognizing multiple levels of truth in situations
- Self-honesty: Willingness to acknowledge uncomfortable realities
- Integrity in action: Consistent expression of understood truth

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by continuously harmonizing inner understanding with outer expression. It acts as an internal compass that detects misalignment between knowledge and action, thought and speech, intention and behavior. Through this detection, it guides adjustment toward greater coherence, much like a musician naturally adjusts to maintain pitch and rhythm.

In practical terms, it manifests as a growing capacity to face reality directly, communicate clearly, and act consistently. This creates trustworthy relationships, enables effective collaboration, and fosters personal growth through honest self-reflection. The quality develops through conscious practice in daily situations, particularly when facing challenges that tempt one to avoid or distort truth.
