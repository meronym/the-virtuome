[Core Definition]
The cultivatable quality of personal power that emerges from the integration of inner dignity with earned recognition, manifesting as authentic presence and ethical authority. It grows through righteous action and diminishes through misconduct, serving as both privilege and responsibility within human relationships.

[Essential Nature]
Personal power exists as a dynamic interplay between internal cultivation and external recognition, fundamentally tied to how one's actions affect others and the broader community. Unlike mere social status or achievement, it represents a deeper form of authority that emerges from the alignment of one's conduct with universal principles, manifesting as a tangible presence that others naturally recognize and respect.

This quality combines responsibility with privilege, requiring both the wisdom to maintain it and the understanding that it exists to serve others rather than oneself. It grows through ethical action and diminishes through misconduct, creating a natural system of accountability that bridges individual development with collective wellbeing.

[Manifestations]
- Commanding presence that attracts natural respect without demanding it
- Dignity in conduct that elevates both self and others
- Ethical authority that influences without coercion
- Demonstrated excellence that inspires rather than intimidates
- Graceful handling of responsibility and privilege
- Natural leadership that emerges from authentic service
- Ability to maintain dignity under pressure

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through a reciprocal relationship between individual conduct and collective recognition. As one acts in alignment with deeper principles, their capacity to positively influence others naturally grows. This influence then creates opportunities for greater responsibility, which, when handled well, further develops the quality. The process is self-regulating, as actions incongruent with this authority naturally diminish it.

In practical terms, it manifests as a form of ethical gravity that draws others toward what is right and noble. Those who embody this quality tend to elevate the conduct of those around them, not through explicit instruction but through their presence and example. This creates a natural hierarchy based on character rather than force, where influence flows from authentic development rather than imposed authority.
