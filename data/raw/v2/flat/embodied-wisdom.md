[Core Definition]
Embodied wisdom is the integration of physical intelligence, practical understanding, and ethical insight that manifests as intuitive expertise in action. It represents the unity of knowing and doing, where understanding is inseparable from its practical expression and emerges through the lived experience of the body in meaningful situations.

[Essential Nature]
Embodied wisdom transcends the traditional separation between theoretical knowledge and practical action, representing a form of understanding that is inherently integrated with physical experience and practical capability. It develops through sustained engagement with meaningful activities, where repeated practice leads to increasingly refined perception, judgment, and action. This wisdom manifests as an intuitive grasp of situations that combines immediate physical understanding with ethical insight and practical effectiveness.

[Manifestations]
- Intuitive expertise in complex situations requiring both physical and ethical understanding
- Seamless integration of perception, judgment, and action in real-time responses
- Enhanced sensitivity to subtle situational factors and contextual nuances
- Refined ability to respond appropriately to novel challenges
- Development of practical excellence through sustained engagement
- Integration of ethical awareness with physical capability
- Cultivation of situation-specific wisdom through experience

[Functional Description]
Embodied wisdom operates through the progressive refinement of integrated perception-action capabilities, where repeated engagement with meaningful situations develops increasingly sophisticated patterns of understanding and response. This development transcends mere mechanical repetition, involving the cultivation of nuanced sensitivity to situational demands and ethical dimensions, leading to a form of practical intelligence that manifests spontaneously in action.

This wisdom functions as a dynamic synthesis of physical intelligence, ethical understanding, and practical capability. It enables individuals to respond effectively to complex situations without requiring conscious deliberation, while maintaining alignment with ethical principles and practical demands. The result is a form of excellence that combines technical skill, moral awareness, and practical effectiveness in a seamless unity.
