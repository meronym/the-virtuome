[Core Definition]
The capacity to remain fully engaged while maintaining inner freedom - a refined relationship with experience that combines complete participation with the absence of compulsive attachment. This quality enables clear perception, wise action, and emotional equilibrium while fostering deep appreciation without dependency.

[Essential Nature]
Non-attachment represents mature psychological freedom rather than withdrawal or indifference. It manifests as the ability to invest full energy and care into activities, relationships, and goals while maintaining inner independence from outcomes. This quality develops through understanding rather than suppression, leading to natural lightness rather than forced detachment.

The essence of this quality lies in recognizing that full engagement does not require psychological dependency. It enables appreciation without clinging, love without possession, and effort without anxiety - allowing for both deeper participation in life and greater inner peace.

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by creating space between experience and identification, allowing for both fuller participation and greater freedom. It develops through progressive insight into the nature of attachment and its relationship to suffering, combined with practical experience in engaging fully while maintaining inner independence.

In practice, this manifests as the capacity to invest fully in work, relationships, and aspirations while maintaining emotional equilibrium and clarity. It enables more effective action by removing the distortions of compulsive attachment, allowing for both deeper engagement and greater adaptability. This quality supports psychological health, decision-making clarity, and the ability to navigate life's changes with wisdom and grace.
