[Core Definition]
The fundamental capacity for reality-alignment that enables accurate perception, authentic expression, and coherent action. It manifests as an active commitment to recognizing, expressing, and maintaining what is real and accurate across all dimensions of human experience and relationship.

[Essential Nature]
Truth as a human quality operates as an integrative force that aligns perception, understanding, communication, and action with what is real. It functions simultaneously as a perceptual capacity (seeing what is), an expressive commitment (representing accurately), and an active practice (maintaining coherence). This quality creates reliability in both individual character and social fabric by establishing consistent correspondence between inner and outer realities.

Beyond mere factual accuracy, it represents the human capacity for authentic presence and integrated being. This encompasses intellectual honesty, emotional authenticity, behavioral integrity, and relational transparency. It serves as both a foundation for trust and a catalyst for growth through continuous reality-verification.

[Manifestations]
- Perceptual clarity: Seeing situations, self, and others accurately without distortion
- Communicative precision: Expressing thoughts and experiences with careful accuracy
- Behavioral consistency: Maintaining alignment between stated principles and actual actions
- Relational authenticity: Creating and maintaining genuine connections based on accurate mutual understanding
- Internal coherence: Developing consistent integration between thought, feeling, and action
- Reality verification: Active checking and adjusting of understanding against evidence
- Trust foundation: Building reliable relationships through consistent accuracy and authenticity

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of perception, expression, and action. It begins with basic recognition of accurate versus inaccurate information, evolves through increasing capacity for honest self-reflection and authentic expression, and matures into an integrated practice of maintaining reality-alignment across all life dimensions. The development process involves both growing perceptual clarity and strengthening the will to maintain accuracy despite challenges.

In practice, this quality enables both personal growth and social trust by creating reliable foundations for understanding and interaction. It manifests as careful attention to accuracy in communication, commitment to promises, consistency in behavior, and courage in facing and expressing reality. This creates both individual integrity and trustworthy social bonds, serving as a fundamental building block for human cooperation and development.
