[Core Definition]
The transformative power of spiritual aspiration that elevates human consciousness through profound attraction to truth, beauty, and goodness. It represents the innate human capacity for self-transcendence through love, operating as both motivating force and transformative agent in human development.

[Essential Nature]
This quality manifests as an intense inner attraction toward what is experienced as higher, truer, or more beautiful in life. It begins as ordinary human love and aspiration but progressively refines itself, becoming an increasingly pure desire for truth and meaning. Unlike ordinary desire which seeks to possess its object, this quality transforms the aspirant through attraction to what transcends them.

Operating simultaneously as motivation and method, it draws consciousness upward while simultaneously refining the capacity for deeper appreciation and understanding. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle of elevation and transformation.

[Manifestations]
- Deep attraction to truth, beauty, and excellence
- Progressive refinement of aspirations and desires
- Spontaneous orientation toward higher meaning
- Increasing capacity for subtle appreciation
- Experience of inspiring elevation
- Transformation through what one loves
- Integration of feeling and understanding

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through progressive refinement of attraction and aspiration. Beginning with ordinary experiences of inspiration and love, it gradually shifts focus from particular objects to universal qualities, transforming both the nature of desire and the consciousness experiencing it. The process involves simultaneous intensification and purification, where stronger attraction paradoxically leads to greater freedom.

In practical terms, it manifests as deepening appreciation for excellence in all forms, growing attraction to truth and wisdom, and increasing capacity for inspiration and elevation. This creates tangible changes in values, priorities, and behavior, naturally orienting life toward what has genuine depth and meaning. The quality becomes both guide and transformer, leading through attraction rather than effort.
