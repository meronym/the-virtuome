[Core Definition]
The cultivated capacity to find genuine satisfaction through wise sufficiency - a dynamic equilibrium where material needs are met without excess, enabling psychological freedom and deeper pursuit of meaning. This quality combines practical moderation with inner contentment, creating sustainable harmony between external resources and internal well-being.

[Essential Nature]
Wise sufficiency operates as an active principle of discernment rather than passive acceptance or denial. It represents the developed ability to recognize and maintain the optimal point where external resources fully support but don't exceed authentic needs. This quality integrates practical wisdom about material requirements with psychological insight into human satisfaction, creating a stable foundation for both individual flourishing and sustainable community life.

This stability doesn't arise from either accumulation or denial, but from the mature understanding of what constitutes "enough" in any given context. It maintains flexibility while establishing reliable boundaries, allowing for appropriate adaptation to changing circumstances without losing its essential balance.

[Manifestations]
- Clear discernment between authentic needs and conditioned wants
- Calm satisfaction with sufficient resources
- Efficient and mindful use of available means
- Natural generosity arising from non-attachment
- Freedom from compulsive acquisition or consumption
- Focused energy for meaningful pursuits
- Resilient contentment amid changing circumstances

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of our relationship with resources and needs. Initially, it appears as practical moderation in consumption and resource use. As it matures, it evolves into psychological freedom from excessive desires, ultimately flowering into a stable wisdom that naturally discerns and maintains optimal sufficiency. This development requires active engagement with both material realities and internal responses, gradually building a reliable capacity for wise discernment.

In practice, this quality manifests as clear-minded resource management, emotional stability regarding material matters, and natural generosity arising from genuine sufficiency. It enables focused pursuit of meaningful goals by eliminating the psychological noise of excessive wants while ensuring genuine needs are met. This creates a sustainable foundation for both individual development and community well-being, promoting both personal peace and social harmony.
