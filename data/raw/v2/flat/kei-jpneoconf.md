[Core Definition]
The quality of profound and active respect that unifies inner recognition of value with outer expression of regard. It manifests as a sustained attitude of reverent attention that elevates both self and other, creating space for genuine connection and growth while maintaining appropriate relationship dynamics.

[Essential Nature]
Reverent attention represents a fundamental orientation of consciousness that recognizes and responds to inherent value - in people, activities, or principles. Unlike simple politeness or formal respect, it embodies a deep internal recognition that naturally shapes external behavior. This quality combines careful attention, genuine regard, and appropriate response into a single unified state.

This state of mind-heart creates optimal conditions for both learning and relationship development by establishing proper distance while enabling authentic connection. It maintains boundaries without creating barriers, and acknowledges hierarchy without diminishing human dignity.

[Functional Description]
This quality operates by establishing an internal orientation that naturally aligns thought, feeling, and action. When fully developed, it creates a state of sustained mindful presence that automatically recognizes and responds to the inherent value in people, principles, and practices. This alignment generates natural dignity in behavior without artificial formality.

In practical expression, it manifests as a composed yet warm presence that puts others at ease while maintaining appropriate boundaries. This quality enables deep learning through careful attention, supports authentic relationships through genuine regard, and facilitates social harmony through natural appropriateness. It serves as a foundation for both personal development and social cohesion.
