[Core Definition]
Sustained engagement represents the capacity to maintain consistent, wholehearted involvement in meaningful practice across all life circumstances. It transforms isolated moments of practice into a continuous flow of dedicated attention, gradually integrating profound principles into every aspect of daily experience.

[Essential Nature]
Sustained engagement operates as a fundamental bridge between isolated moments of practice and comprehensive life transformation. It transcends the conventional distinction between "practice time" and "regular life," creating instead a seamless continuum of engaged presence. This quality combines careful attention with natural flow, deliberate cultivation with spontaneous expression, and focused discipline with effortless continuation.

Rather than representing mere persistence or repetition, it embodies the progressive integration of practice principles into every dimension of experience, allowing deeper understanding to emerge through consistent, wholehearted engagement with each moment's activities.

[Manifestations]
- Maintaining practice consistency through changing circumstances
- Natural integration of practice principles into daily activities
- Fluid transition between different forms of engagement
- Progressive deepening of understanding through sustained attention
- Emergence of spontaneous wisdom from continued practice
- Development of effortless presence in all activities
- Transformation of ordinary actions into opportunities for growth

[Functional Description]
Sustained engagement develops through an initial period of deliberate, conscious effort that gradually transforms into natural, spontaneous expression. This process begins with structured practice periods and expands to encompass increasingly diverse situations and activities. The practitioner learns to maintain continuity of awareness and engagement while adapting to changing circumstances, allowing deeper insights to emerge through persistent, wholehearted participation in each moment.

In practical terms, this quality manifests as an ability to maintain practice momentum regardless of external conditions or internal states. It enables the practitioner to transform everyday activities into opportunities for development, while simultaneously deepening formal practice through consistent engagement. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where practice enhances daily life, and daily life becomes an extension of practice, leading to increasingly natural and comprehensive integration.
