[Core Definition]
The innate human capacity to discern, choose, and act based on ethical understanding, integrating moral awareness with personal identity and behavioral choice. It represents our fundamental ability to recognize right from wrong, take responsibility for our actions, and actively shape our character through conscious choices.

[Essential Nature]
Moral agency emerges from the intersection of consciousness, choice, and responsibility. It manifests as our ability to recognize ethical dimensions in situations, deliberate on right action, and choose our response while accepting the consequences of our decisions. This capacity transcends mere rule-following, representing instead our fundamental power to shape ourselves and our world through ethically-informed action.

This quality integrates cognitive understanding, emotional awareness, and behavioral control into a coherent capacity for ethical self-direction. It develops through experience and reflection, gradually transforming from external guidance to internalized wisdom, becoming a core aspect of personal identity and human dignity.

[Functional Description]
Moral agency operates through a dynamic interplay of awareness, reflection, and choice. When faced with situations having ethical implications, it enables us to pause, recognize moral dimensions, consider alternatives, and choose actions aligned with our values. This capacity grows stronger through exercise, developing from simple recognition of rules to sophisticated ethical reasoning and ultimately to embodied wisdom expressing itself naturally in action.

In daily life, moral agency manifests as the continuous process of making conscious choices that shape our character and impact others. It enables us to resist harmful impulses, stand up for what we believe is right, take responsibility for our actions, and actively contribute to the ethical fabric of our communities. This capacity becomes particularly visible in challenging situations where competing values or pressures must be navigated.
