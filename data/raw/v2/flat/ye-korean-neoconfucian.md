[Core Definition]
The capacity to navigate human relationships and social situations with graceful awareness, expressing deeper moral understanding through appropriate form and conduct. It manifests as the natural embodiment of ethical principles in relationship patterns, ceremonial activities, and daily interactions.

[Essential Nature]
This quality represents the sophisticated integration of moral understanding with social expression, where external form becomes a vehicle for deeper meaning. It operates as a bridge between internal cultivation and external behavior, providing structure for human interactions while simultaneously expressing and developing moral awareness. Rather than mere etiquette, it embodies the wisdom of how human relationships can be conducted in ways that honor both individual dignity and collective harmony.

- Ability to express respect and consideration without rigid formality

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a dynamic interplay between understanding principles and practicing forms. Initially learned through specific protocols and guidelines, it gradually evolves into an intuitive sense of appropriate conduct. The practitioner moves from conscious attention to form toward natural expression of underlying principles, eventually embodying them spontaneously in all interactions.

In practice, it manifests as a kind of social wisdom that creates harmony without apparent effort. It allows individuals to maintain authentic self-expression while honoring social contexts and relationships. This quality enables meaningful participation in both formal ceremonies and casual interactions, transforming routine social exchanges into opportunities for expressing and developing moral awareness.
