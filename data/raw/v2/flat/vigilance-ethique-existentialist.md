[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain active ethical awareness and critical moral consciousness in daily life, combining careful attention to the consequences of one's choices with ongoing reflection about values and responsibilities. This quality enables thoughtful navigation of complex moral situations while remaining true to one's deepest principles.

[Essential Nature]
Ethical vigilance represents the dynamic intersection of awareness and moral responsibility, manifesting as an ever-present consciousness of the ethical dimension in human experience. Unlike rigid rule-following or occasional moral deliberation, it embodies a continuous state of ethical alertness and reflection. This quality combines keen situational awareness with deep consideration of values, consequences, and responsibilities.

This alertness operates across multiple dimensions - from immediate personal choices to broader social implications - while maintaining sensitivity to context, complexity, and the interconnected nature of ethical decisions. It enables one to recognize moral dimensions in seemingly ordinary situations and to maintain ethical consciousness even in challenging or ambiguous circumstances.

- Regular self-examination of motives and consequences
- Active consideration of others' perspectives and needs

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through the cultivation of both sensitivity and discernment. It begins with conscious effort to recognize ethical dimensions in everyday situations, gradually evolving into a more natural state of moral awareness. This development involves building capacity for nuanced perception, learning from experience, and maintaining ethical consciousness even under pressure or in routine situations. The quality strengthens through regular practice of reflection, honest self-examination, and careful consideration of consequences.

In practical application, ethical vigilance manifests as a consistent background awareness that informs both major decisions and subtle daily choices. It enables one to navigate complex situations with greater wisdom, recognize ethical implications before they become problems, and maintain integrity across varying contexts. This quality helps bridge the gap between abstract values and concrete actions, supporting both personal development and positive social impact.
