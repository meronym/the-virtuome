[Core Definition]
The capacity to maintain clear, wise action in the face of difficulty, danger, or opposition. It integrates physical resolve with moral conviction, enabling one to both act and refrain from action based on ethical understanding rather than mere fearlessness or impulse.

[Essential Nature]
Courage manifests as an internal clarity and strength that transforms challenging situations from threats into opportunities for right action. It operates through the integration of three elements: the physical capacity to act despite fear, the moral wisdom to discern right action, and the spiritual clarity to maintain perspective under pressure.

This quality transcends mere fearlessness or bravado, representing instead a mature capacity to respond to circumstances with both power and wisdom. It develops through progressive challenges that unite physical, moral, and spiritual aspects of human experience.

[Manifestations]
- Physical steadiness and calm presence during crisis or conflict
- Clear decision-making under pressure or opposition
- Standing firmly for principles despite personal cost
- Protecting others or important values despite risk
- Speaking truth to power with respect and wisdom
- Taking responsible action despite uncertainty
- Restraining action when wisdom indicates patience

[Functional Description]
This quality develops through a progressive integration of physical, emotional, and ethical capacities. Initial development focuses on managing fear and building basic resolve. This foundation then expands to include moral discernment, leading to the ability to distinguish between situations requiring action or restraint. The mature expression integrates these aspects into a unified capacity for wise, powerful action.

In practical application, it manifests as a composed, clear presence in challenging situations. This presence enables both decisive action and measured restraint, guided by ethical understanding rather than reactive impulses. It supports leadership, protection of values, and ethical decision-making while maintaining internal peace and external effectiveness.
