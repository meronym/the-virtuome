[Functional Description]
This quality develops through progressive refinement of social awareness combined with deepening self-knowledge. It begins with conscious attention to social impact and evolves into intuitive understanding of how to contribute to collective harmony. The development process involves both internal cultivation of awareness and external practice in varied social contexts, gradually integrating into natural, unforced expression.
