[Core Definition]
Practical wisdom is the developed capacity to recognize, understand, and effectively navigate moral situations through reasoned judgment. It enables one to bridge the gap between ethical understanding and concrete action, integrating principle with circumstance to determine right conduct in complex situations.

[Essential Nature]
Practical wisdom represents the mature expression of our capacity for moral reasoning in action. Unlike purely theoretical understanding or mere tactical cleverness, it embodies the integration of ethical insight with practical judgment. This quality enables us to recognize the moral dimension of situations, weigh competing considerations, and determine appropriate action while maintaining integrity of principle.

This capacity develops through the conscious application of moral understanding to real situations, refined by reflection on experience and deepened through confrontation with increasingly complex challenges. It manifests as a kind of ethical expertise that combines clarity of principle with nuanced appreciation of circumstance.

[Manifestations]
- Clear recognition of moral dimensions in complex situations
- Balanced consideration of principles, circumstances, and consequences
- Effective navigation of competing obligations and values
- Integration of universal principles with particular contexts
- Development of reliable judgment through experience
- Growing capacity to handle increasing complexity
- Ability to guide others in ethical decision-making

[Functional Description]
Practical wisdom operates as an active synthesis of moral understanding and experiential knowledge. It develops through a continuous cycle of application, reflection, and refinement, where theoretical knowledge is tested against reality and modified through experience. This faculty enables us to recognize patterns in moral situations, anticipate consequences, and identify appropriate responses that honor both principle and circumstance.

In daily life, this quality manifests as reliable judgment in challenging situations, the ability to find ethically sound solutions to complex problems, and the capacity to help others navigate moral difficulties. It shows itself in the way we handle conflicts between competing obligations, adapt universal principles to particular circumstances, and maintain ethical integrity while achieving practical objectives.
