[Core Definition]
The capacity to discover, create, and embody significance in human experience through active engagement with life's fundamental questions, leading to coherent understanding of one's place and purpose in the larger fabric of existence. This quality enables the transformation of raw experience into meaningful patterns that inform purposeful action.

[Essential Nature]
Meaning-orientation manifests as an inherent human capacity to engage with questions of significance and purpose, operating simultaneously as a perceptual lens, an integrative force, and a directive compass. It involves both receptivity to discover meaning and creativity to generate it, functioning as the bridge between immediate experience and larger patterns of significance. This quality enables the transformation of disconnected experiences into coherent narratives while maintaining openness to new understanding and deeper layers of significance.

[Manifestations]
• Recognition of patterns and significance in daily experience
• Integration of challenging experiences into coherent understanding
• Alignment of actions with deeply held values and purposes
• Creation of connection between personal story and larger contexts
• Discovery of significance in ordinary moments and tasks
• Translation of understanding into purposeful action
• Development of increasingly inclusive meaning frameworks

[Functional Description]
This quality operates through continuous interplay between experience and reflection, where encounters with life are processed through both intuitive recognition and conscious contemplation. It involves a dynamic balance between receiving existing meaning and creating new significance, functioning as an internal compass that orients both perception and action. The capacity develops through progressive integration of experience, leading to increasingly sophisticated and inclusive frameworks of understanding.

In practice, meaning-orientation manifests as the ability to maintain direction and purpose amid life's complexities while remaining open to new understanding. It enables individuals to navigate challenges by placing them in larger contexts, find significance in ordinary experiences, and align daily actions with deeper purposes. This quality supports resilience through difficulty, enriches relationship through shared meaning, and facilitates contribution through purposeful engagement.
