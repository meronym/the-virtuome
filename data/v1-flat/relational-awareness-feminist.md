## Definition

## Key Aspects
- Recognition of fundamental human interdependence
- Attention to context and relationship dynamics
- Understanding of care relationships and responsibilities
- Awareness of power dynamics in relationships
- Integration of autonomy and connection

## Historical Development
Emerged from feminist critiques of traditional ethical frameworks' emphasis on autonomous individualism. Developed through care ethics and maternal practice theory, particularly in works of Gilligan, Noddings, and Ruddick.

## Contemporary Relevance
Essential for addressing modern social challenges, workplace dynamics, and environmental issues. Crucial for ethical leadership and community building.
