# Karuṇā (करुणा) - Compassion

## Definition
Karuṇā represents the wish to remove suffering from all beings, coupled with active engagement in alleviating that suffering. In Mahayana Buddhism, it becomes mahākaruṇā (great compassion), a defining quality of bodhisattvas.

## Key Aspects
- Recognition of suffering
- Genuine concern for others
- Active engagement in helping
- Non-discriminative application
- Freedom from pity or condescension

## Historical Development
Present in early Buddhism as one of the four Brahmaviharas, later elevated in Mahayana Buddhism as essential to the bodhisattva path alongside wisdom (prajñā).

## Contemporary Relevance
Central to Buddhist-inspired approaches to psychology, healthcare, social work, and conflict resolution. Basis for contemplative practice in secular contexts.
